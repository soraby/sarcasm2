That may be because I just don't understand what you are writing.I thought you were arguing that there is no right of same-sex couples to marry but that they should be allowed to marry anyway. It sounded like a nuanced argument to me. But apparently that is not what you were saying? Can you clarify this?Thanks."
notsarc,139,"In a sense you really can. From the perspective of if niether Islam or Christianity existed there would be no AQ or KKK. The question then is would they have existed anyway? To do so they would have to have radically different access to resources, social acceptance and support, ideological motivation and all of these would need a reason to endour over time surviving cultural, geographical and population shifts.It's one thing to say religion is good, just used poorly, but when will it start being used correctly all the time? It's like having a TV that has a 1 in 3 chance of everytime you turn it on it will explode. At some point you stop buying TV's."
notsarc,140,"Reread my argument, please. I don't see incest as good or anything. What I do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring (all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest, not consequences of incest). And here, I see hipocrisy. We're prohibiting incest, but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist. Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related? Prohibit regardless of chance. And really, I would actually fully support such a (yes, very invasive) globally consistent policy. The double standard annoys me, not that I advocate incest (something people here fail to acknowledge)."

notsarc,210,Why do you oppose gay marriage? The traditional definition of marriage is as a contract for the purchase of a bride. The wedding is what is sacred. What you are doing is no different than those who opposed marriage betwen people of different races or beliefs as well. You have no valid reason to oppose it either.
notsarc,211,"You two are on the same side, you just don't know it yet. And you're both friends of mine so shake hands and make up willya? emoticonXHohoemoticonXGoodAnd yes's video IS very disturbing because it shows that in a time of natural catastrophe's or mass turmoil, our Government will confiscate guns from law abiding citizens. During the LA riots after the Rodney King verdict, the Gov't ordered all gun shops to lock down and to stop selling ammunition. So even law abiding citizens with legally registered weapons couldn't buy ammo to protect themselves."
notsarc,212,"YOU LIAR.You are distorting the truth the same way Moore did. The truth is the NRA event was planned 1 year before the killings in Littleton. The truth is the NRA rally was canceled excpet for the officers meetings which is required by LAW to NOT BE CANCELED. HESTON said ""FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS"" in North Carolina 1 year later.And what transcript are you talking about? The transcript is posted above. What big pro-gun rally are you talking about in Denver. Do you mean the one that NEVER happened?"
notsarc,213,That just sounds alarmist to me. Do you realize the actual implications of taking away second amendment rights? It is just not going to happen.
notsarc,214,"Your writing is as muddled as your thinking.I assume the ""they"" here is the IPCC? Are you seriously asking why radiative forcing (which can be accurately calculated using line-by-line radiative transfer codes, see Collins et al. 2006 and Myhre et al. 2001) is relevant to the issue of global warming?"
notsarc,215,"Well for one thing religion is specificly mentioned in the constitution, not as 100% protected but in that gov't cannot mandate a religion. Also, religion is not unilateraly protected, as I've stated several times. There are many restrictions put on religion by government and if government can restrict religion then why not which marriages they recognise? That being said I have long been a supporter of limited gov't and believe that gov't has no business endorsing or giving advantages to any marriage. They should be silent on the subject."
notsarc,216,"Don't be so faithful in our laws. Remember prohibition? Of course, I myself highly doubt that Obama will manage to ban firearms, but mark my words, he will do anything in his power to restrict them."

notsarc,218,"I don't believe that Orthodox doctrine deals directly with WWII. I am unfamiliar with such. Are you saying that the event you stated had a direct bearing on the cause of the war?Our doctrine would deal with evil, in general. But there may be Orthodox writers who have commented on the war. We are a Church with doctrine, but it would take more than a number of writers commenting on something to make it a 'doctrine'.Armenia was the first nation on earth to adopt Christianity."
notsarc,219,"Hahaha  yes , bashing Reagan, Bush, and just about every high profile conservative out there is a really good way to prove it. Youve reinforced your proof with almost complete lack of confrontation with far left posters here, like Simone, Chester, and countless others. All your disdain of talk radio and Fox news helps a lot too. A book could be filled with all of your put-downs of Bush, have you said anything bad at all about Obama yet? Unlike past years, nothing I see at this place surprises me anymore."
notsarc,220,"Quite frankly, that makes absolutely no sense.So conservatives in the blue states will buy more porn because why? Cause they are in a blue state?And liberals in the red states will buy more porn because why? Cause they arein a red state?Your excuses lack any cogent theory behind the scenario.In science, when people put forth a hypothesis they provide a basis for their claim as to the mechanics of the phenomenon.But with you, you just throw out different ideas with no basis."
notsarc,221,So it's not like they are just pocketing insane profits they actualy are using the profits to improve the drugs they have and R&D. Just a note wouldn't the modifications still be considered R&D? I'm not doubting you it is just my take. I'm assuming that alot of testing and research would still have to be done in the mods & that the 5% would be on the lines of new research.
notsarc,222,What kind of quality? How about speed?Free but slow and crappy healthcare is not acceptable and I'd vote a solid no.

notsarc,225,"You failed to answer a question. Have you had an abortion? I'm not arguing against abortion or for it, I'm arguing against your faulty premise that the abortion debate can't be related to slavery. Cite your source on that APA study. Because I found multiple sources that say while some women feel relieved, others have emotional problems. I would like to know whether these women had early or late-term abortions. Either way, I doubt the majority is relieved."
notsarc,226,"The same could be said of Clinton.Tell me. How do people learn if you insist on covering up these situations?If a person like Sanford isn't exposed to his own medicine, how will he (or others) not recognize how it tastes?Furthermore, I find your perspective a little baffling.What he said ""many years ago""? Is that something he should be embarrassed of, because he was wrong?Or should he be embarrassed cause he got caught?Cause the standard of not cheating on your wife is not a bad standard. It's a good standard.We have too many politicians who look out for their own interests, and say things just for political gain not to take it seriously."
notsarc,227,"Exactly my point. And do you know why evolutionists love to use fruit flies as subjects in experiments like these? it's because their lifespan is so incredibly short, around 2 weeks long, so many generations can be observed in a shorter amount of time making the probability of observing an actual change more likely. But as we saw with Iangb's e coli experiment, even 40,000+ generations of e coli wasn't enough for it to evolve into anything other than another strain of e coli. emoticonXGoodLife Cycle of the Fruit Fly"
notsarc,228,"yes it is...you said.. """"""""""They should keep it to themselves, if they believe homosexuality is ""deviant"".

notsarc,230,"In private homes? No. Smoke detector and a fire blanket are fairly common. Standard practice in a fire in a private home is get everyone out, closing doors behind you and let the fire brigade deal with it. We pay part of our council tax to train professionals, it's safer all round if they're allowed to get on with their job. Plus almost all our housing is brick or stonework, so holds up longer in a fire and can be repaired more easily.The police don't carry guns because they don't need them, and the consequences of accidents and screw-ups are much greater when you've shot someone in the chest as opposed to hitting them with a baton or CS spray. There is a big difference between a life jacket or seatbelt where the only function is lifesaving, and a gun which is intended to kill."
notsarc,231,Did he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships? Probably not. Are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent? Yes. There are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights.
notsarc,232,"so God would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom. how very libertarian of you, jyoshu.but actually, are evil and freedom inversely proportionate? look at the examples i gave: slavery is both evil and an infringement on human freedom. on top of that, God puts evil into people and then does not take responsibility when these people do evil things... not to mention the evil that he himself has done. murder, genocide, bigotry... the lot.if he made people with complete freedom, he MUST have made people with evil as well. why did he do that? the only reason i can come up with is that if God made everyone in his image, he himself must be evil, even partially. that that is apparent in the bible."
notsarc,233,What is the point of this comment? I consistently see it brought up by people of a certain political persuasion. How is this a slam against Obama? Can anyone name a recent president who didn't regularily use a teleprompter? And yet somehow the fact that Obama uses one is a sign of his ineptitude? How?
notsarc,234,"Inconsistent how? If you give me specific quotes of mine that were inconsistent, I will be more able to respond. I never said I didn't know. I said there is no empirical evidence. That is not synonymous with not knowing. The word ""proof"" as I am using it is subjective. What if proof enough for me is not for you. What is proof for me is not empirical. According to my definition, I have proof. It's just not proof that you will accept. It comes down to a simple difference of epistemology. I believe that personal metaphysical evidences can be accepted, you don't. End of story."
notsarc,235,Once again you reveal a cruel God who creates people then puts a tree there and tells them not to touch it. Why put the tree there in the first place? If you have children you do not put candy in front of them then tell them not to touch without explaining to the consequences that they can not understand. You put the candy up and out of sight.
notsarc,236,"Clear up some more muddled thinking for jo. As stated, that is from the Declaration of Independence. When was it penned?The Constitution would not have been ratified without the BOR being included. When were those rights penned and when was it adopted? The Declaration simply told England why we were separating and why, it had nothing to do with the BOR."
notsarc,237,"Ever been to eastern KY? Many of the residents share a very strong faith in the christian religion. They also share abject poverty, malnutrition and starvation, substandard or absent medical care, contaminated water supplies, and dangerous and often poorly heated / ventilated ""housing"". Yes Easy, truly their cups overfloweth."
notsarc,238,"What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes ""conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms"" per Heller. If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. However, that does not mean that there is a Constitutional right to shoplift."
notsarc,239,like most things in christianity as the catholic church got organized. http://kevinantoine.com/holytrinity.htm now why does that matter? the burden of proof is yours to prove that god exists and the bible is his communication to man. you have made absolutely no progress towards that end. do not think my speculation on the evolution of the internal inconsistencies of christianity in any way substitutes for that responsibility.
notsarc,240,"prosecutors of every party under pressure to keep their conviction rate up? it's not an unreasonable argument to say it's better to make sure the criminal is put away than gamble on the risks in a trial of intimidated witnesses, forensic screw-ups etc. it's also not unreasonable to suggest that the harm done by making child abuse or rape victims give evidence in court outweigh that done by a small reduction in setence for the perpetrator."
notsarc,241,"you're using scale as a limiting factor in this argument - are you not? you accept that small changes can change a genome, but you don't allow the small changes to accumulate into a large change. instead, you insist that large changes must happen suddenly.  distinguishing between micro and macro evolution, accepting one and denying the other, is like distinguishing between micro and macro erosion, claiming that sure, and inch or two can erode off that mountain, but the whole mountain? something else is behind this mountainous disappearance because erosion just doesn't explain it."
notsarc,242,"what's wrong with gradualism? is it not statistically inevitable? by blending of traits, do you mean that you can't have active both genes from two parents? it seems like there would be exceptions to this. also, traits are rarely controlled by a single gene. would this not mean a trait could be derived from both maternal and paternal genes?"
notsarc,243,nato are you serious!? please don't tell me you are buying this too!?!?!?! you can repeal any amendment! by repealing the 2nd amendment you could enact whatever gun law you wanted. even the american spectator talks about that. i'm hoping i just misunderstand you. the american spectator : repeal the second amendment?
notsarc,244,"ridiculous. if ic cannot support id, id has absolutely nothing going for it, right? including their supporters of ic, since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id. behe is wrong, dembski is wrong, johnson is wrong, every id supporter is wrong for using ic, because freedom the great thinks it's wrong. daewoo: ic is irreducible complexity, the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process, but had to have been formed all at once, by a designer with a function in mind. id is intelligent design, creationism with new pseudo-scientific skin, a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect. it failed. michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic."
notsarc,245,"that's a real laugh, coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you. do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else? right. and it was ca law that lead to a father's children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time, making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency. it was also california law that proved just how registration can, does and will, lead to confiscation. they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we weren't paranoid, and instead knew exactly what we were talking about."
notsarc,246,"i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws."
notsarc,247,"it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools, especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly-equipped machine shop. also, why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not, and show no indication of wanting to, unjustly hurt anyone with these tools?  it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions, just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision-machined metal/polymer/wood objects in their own homes."
notsarc,248,"this is absolutely incorrect on your part. an intentional lie? the phrase certainly is there, in the greek. ('   .') you really need to stop making claims about things you just don't know that much about. (http://biblos.com/mark/7-19.htm)"

notsarc,250,how can i possibly address that specific quote when god contradicts that very statement in so many ways?  it virtually renders the passage null.
notsarc,251,"you havent answered my question. if evolution is lacking the hard, observable evidence you say it's lacking, then surely you should have lots to say about atomic theory. however, you dont. why not? unification theory is different - theres no dependency on that theory like there is with chemistry or biology."
notsarc,252,"just how many cases do you want to read that says exactly what i am quoting? i just gave you a taste of things to come...like the right to be left alone. even the 10 year census, all that is required by the xivth amendment i: 1. number of people who live there 2. sex of each 3. age of each that completes the enumeration and registration for the census. i will ask the 3rd time before i cover you up with cases, show me the enumerated power of any branch of government to require a person to register any right, much less firearms."
notsarc,253,"well, that's really the issue, isn't it? saying that one believes in a deity or admires the moral teachings of jesus is not the same as being a christian. such belief and admiration is quite compatible with rejecting organized christianity in particular and organized religion in general, at both the personal and political levels. and many of the founding fathers, including the more famous among them like franklin and jefferson and washington, clearly rejected organized religion in this way. it is either wilful ignorance or flagrant dishonesty to claim otherwise."
notsarc,254,where are the big gay movements in zimbabwe? where were the big gay movements in 16th spain. there has been cases of brothers and sisters meeting after being apart and having sexual relationships..they cant even have legal sex never mind marry. when homosexuality was made legal in the uk there was no gay couples fighting to marry. they would have been ridiculed or worse . show me cases of pre ww2 gays campaigning for the right to marry in texas . its not likely is it? not in the uk..we have no written constitution( you may be surprised but the usa is only a relatively small part of the world). it was proposed to parliament by a prominent politician ( roy jenkins i think) and the law was repealed. that doesnt really matter it was judged by both the states and the uk to be unfair by mostly straight politicians
notsarc,255,if easyrider is so concerned about pedophilia (which he isn't he's just using it as a lame excuse to scapegoat homosexuals) why then doesn't he speak out again the catholic church and the cover up their doing on their sex scandals? you know who actively does care about the well being of these children? atheists. atheists like richard dawkins. wheres your slippery slope on morality now easy?
notsarc,256,"then why is it that closeted homosexuals that are completely unknown to be gay commit suicide at such a high rate? they aren't persecuted or harassed at all since no one knows they are even having these feeling? it is self loathing that feeds their desire to harm themselves. people who know that what they are is right and good, don't harm themselves at all, but defend and support who they are even when persecuted by others. that's how it was for me when i converted from islam to christianity. all of the persecution i received just made me stronger."
notsarc,257,"obama said no such thing. who said i don't blame loughner? he will be dealt with by the judicial system. but we must take responsibility as a society for the violence that occurs within our communities. he was encouraged, he was incited, he was instigated. do you think that hitler, with his rhetoric, did not bear any responsibility for the night of broken glass?"
notsarc,258,"so?? it was still a speech made for the purpose of political support of gay marriage. yes, i watched it. agreed. it was for the purpose of appealing to emotion (to a political end). no, but my point is that neither does the sanitized 'norman rockwell' image that some gay-pride proponents want projected by linking to videos such as the one here. it might give the impression that gay pride is merely some 'family-friendly' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it."
notsarc,259,"why do you refuse to address the atf emails showing that they were building support for new authority to regulate and dictate firearms sales? they are truly right there, out in the open and viewable by literally everyone. why do you ignore them?"

notsarc,270,"are they the ones going to nigeria and whose result of preachings there end up with gays getting killed? the funny thing is that in another thread, i challenged you for evidence that christians rebuke fred phelps... and here, it's obvious that you're punting on the issue of the christian involvement on the issue, providing an excellent example of you being guilty of what you tried to accuse gays of doing. emoticonxmad the irony of that statement is rather underwhelming. if the situation had been turned around between gays and christians, you would be beating this drum like a red-headed step child. emoticonxrolleyes"

notsarc,283,"mike, you seem to imply that the story in genesis is false (whether intentionally or not), yet you accept the rest of the bible as true in its entirety? what about the flood, the plagues, the exodus on a whole? what about the other miraculous and unscientifically supernatural phenomenon that the bible describes? do you believe that these events took place at all? the bible does not only oppose science's theories of universal origin, it also opposes a huge amount of natural laws of physics. would you say that the bible is true and the events in it really occured?"
notsarc,284,"do you really think that there is no difference between bush and kerry? i am actually a fan of the run-off system used by france. many people run, and then the top two candidates participate in a run-off at a later date (unless the top one already has a majority, in which case they are declared elected.) however, in the absence of such a system, i think that the two-party system is best. voters have a choice, but yet there are not so many choices that the winner has little support."
notsarc,285,"so lets ban cars... they kill people... and think all the money could go to public transportation. also we should ban baseball bats as thats the obvious next step in weaponry... don't forget archery... can't have the subjects have any of that... since we are taking away all these weapons to coddle the masses, will the government be disarming too? i see a need for both kinds of weapons as a freeman."
notsarc,286,"actually it is true. as i'm sure that i have stated before, either on this thread or on another thread, vacuum fluctuations must presuppose that there was something to fluctuate - the 'quantum vacuum' is a lot of matter-antimatter potential - not 'nothing'. can you give me an internet site (s) for reference please? on my own admission i don't know much about quantum physics, so any additional information would be really appreciated!  thanking you ahead, matt."
notsarc,287,"economically it is great. heck, it would even be better if robots did all our jobs for us at almost no expense. sure the corporations would be fine with that because they would profit but what about the average person who cannot find a job? sending jobs over seas doesn't hurt our economy but it doesn't help billy who lost his job to it. i'm not suggesting that we stop outsourcing jobs but i am suggesting that while our jobless rate increases that our government do something to keep some jobs here."
notsarc,288,"are you speaking of the federal marriage ammendment to the u.s. constitution? everything i've heard indicates it's a long shot. at any rate, it is just a guess what will or won't happen a few years in the future. i was just pointing out what was happening internationally(mass. is international for me, a canadian)."
notsarc,289,becasue tehre is no merit to the behavior that would need special recognition. should people with attachment disorders be allowed to be polygamists? what is so special about homosexuality that it deserves to be treated different than other behaviors? remember there is no definitve evidence that it is genetic.
notsarc,290,"i am sorry that is just daft, and totally socially unresponsible. what if you marry someone from abroad? government recogniction is required to apply for emigration. what if your spouse was taken severly ill? without government recognized marriage you don't have the right to take time off to care for them. what if you want to adopt? surely marriage needs to be recognized as the best environment for this. what if you marry someone already with a child? it gives you rights over this child. what if your spouse dies before making a will? who is responsible for any ophans? the biological parent even if the kid had been raised their entire life by their step-parent? the list is endless."
notsarc,291,"what time frame are you referencing? back in the time of christ marriage was a practical thing, you needed a wife to bear children, and raise them, and it was not a religious thing. in the middle ages, the nobility would marry in the church. do you think there was no political? did you mean recently, where marriage has become a legal thing?  i am trying to clarify when you are referring to."
notsarc,292,"you guys just don't get it do you? this isn't about an attack on christianity. this isn't about anti-christians, and in the end, this isn't about the cross, or any other religious symbol for that matter, offending anyone. this is about keeping religion from meddling with government, but just as, if not more, important, it is about keeping government from meddling with religion, and the moment they intertwine, there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen. and by the way, i'm a christian, and i don't want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear. p.s. sandycane- most buddhists aren't in india."
notsarc,293,i am a fan! do you think courtney had anything to do with his death?  just curious what other people think about that theory.
notsarc,294,but why can't they be content in another term besides marriage that has all the same benefits as marriage? that's my point.
notsarc,295,"i'd say out of the 6 billion people on earth at least 4 billion of them are richer right now than they would be had the economic systems never changed since the era of globalization began. i don't think the number is as small as 3 people. how doesn't it lead to stability. think china and their reform to capitalism and westernization. are them more of a threat to the world as a communist nation or as a globalized nation? it will be stabilizing to have them westernize. however, it isn't necessarily good. yeah i can see what you mean. the people are just about ready to burst because the us and canada depend so much on each other. nor did i. whew, we agree on something :) isn't that the truth."
notsarc,296,"even with tax deductible status, i seriously doubt there's enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern. since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program, it seems like government is still the only option now. sure, the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides, but what are they really learning or advancing there? they're getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station. the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite-launching business; again, where's the hard science? so it seems to fall to the americans -- surprise. but if we don't do it, the chinese certainly will. in all probabilities, they will be fierce competitors, imo."
notsarc,297,"i already understand this quite well, thank you. :) though wasn't jesus christ allegedly alive as a human being on this earth for closer to 33 years? ;) didn't the church also refute the evidence of galileo by its authority? and specifically to which church are you referring? because there are several churches -- including the roman catholic church -- which do not claim to refute the evidence of evolution by their authority. or do none of the other churches count because they are not the one, true church? peace, the bootfitter"
notsarc,298,"did i happen to say that genes had no influence on who you are? no? please read what i said earlier, there's more to you than your enviroment or genes, there's also your personal choices and beliefs."
notsarc,299,"i asked on another thread, but it fits here as well... is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x? before, i suggested that i couldn't see a distinction, but after pondering it for awhile, i believe there is a distinction between the two: if one asserts that there is no god (or gods), this is a belief in the absence of god. if one makes no assertions one way or another (even internally), then this would be an absence of belief. i'm not certain into which 'side' atheism would fall, though i believe it would have to be the former, and therefore, a belief. the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me. but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic."
notsarc,300,"i think you are looking at it backwards. there is definatly a side here that should remind of us nazi germany, but it isn't the muslims. when has any muslim claimed they were fighting becasue they hated our culture, our lifestyle or our religion?  they are fighting because they hate our foreign policy. they hate the fact that we support tyrants and dictators all over the world (like in saudi arabia). they hate the fact we send our troops all over the world and meddel on other peoples affairs and force our culture and business models on the rest of the planet.  right now, there are american troops in iraq for the purpose of imposing our political system and social structure on a third party.  i think the question should be, is america the new nazis?"
notsarc,301,"this i do not agree with. i cannot see how the court could rule in favor of doma based on 14th amendment protections. as far as the law goes, the marriage license from couple a from state 1 is the same as the license from couple b from the same state. how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a, yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state? that is unconstitutional."
notsarc,302,i live in the seattle area and the city boasts there are no differnce in the benefits..........can you cite a link? thanks.......
notsarc,303,"1) i dont recall saying anything that i believed 2) someones experiences should definitly be looked at you are just one rude person. i was just sharing an experience my mom had teaching. not only that, youe are comparing a pedophiliac to a gay man adopting. what does this prove? i never said all striaight families are perfect and i never said all gay families are bad either. all i stated was one persons direct observations on the situation. how many child of gay couples have you taught? observed? 30 years worth? i believe i will take someones experience over you being rude."
notsarc,304,"which state laws are you refering to? as far as i know there is nothing in the us constitution which would require states to perform gay weddings, just to recognizes weddings performed in other states."
notsarc,305,"can you guess why they have these items? i know. do you? it's quite practical for both officers and inmates.  how bout not having a riot in the first place and not having to shoot anyone. if you can prevent it, do it. it causes less pain and suffereing and is less damaging."
notsarc,306,"which you posted. i think it was fair enough for me to take that as you supporting his views. i think both factors had a lot to do with it for us, and by the same token i don't think you can claim that france's decision was purely economic either. i agree. not quite sure i follow. are you saying that france not standing by the us constitutes a crime? i support the war, and think we were correct to do what we thought was right. but by the same token i find it very hypocritical to continually bad mouth the french for doing the same."
notsarc,307,"and as i've already pointed out, this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale. why would god in any way need -- or even want -- to demonstrate his glory? he's god: he knows how glorious he is! isn't that enough? and again, as already pointed out, i don't find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful, nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just. the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant."
notsarc,308,"so their support of bush (so you say) means exactly what? that they were listening to the sound bytes dished out by bush's rhetoric? and where is bush is the man and jim's trucking? usually they're all over it when someone says something bad about the american people. oh, that's right... it's ok when a person on the right says it, it's when it said by a liberal like moore that it becomes an issue."
notsarc,309,"yes, and they were also treated very commonly with animal dung, saw dust, and variose other fast-killing medicines. patients were often posioned. egyptians learned all that they had by trial and error. its a known fact. please, even you should know that the hebrews used much, much more advanced technology than that. who were the occultists citing here? besides, this is only the tip of the iceburg of my argument. even if your correct, my argument stands."
notsarc,310,"if this is true, then it's a pity you were absent from mizmaxx's thread 'harry potter is more popular than jesus' thread. how would it 'turn out that he never existed at all'? are you expecting some proof of non-existence? that would depend on the message. if you claimed to be able to levitate, but offered no proofs, then your message would be tied into the source - if you lack credibility, or not. jesus was not just here to provide 'a messge'. he was not a lifestyle guru with a really neat attitude to life. he was the son of god."
notsarc,311,"i don't follow. 'since those of specific faith...' ???? if you don't believe god, then there is no sin. those that do would choose neither of the above over another. of course, there are some here that would, but that's religion for you."
notsarc,312,you actually bring up an interesting point. just how silly is it for people to go on about the 'lies' of an adminastration that obviously risked being un-elected by going to war long before the election season only to find no wmd's. another point to stress is that saddam's threat to the us need not be measured by the size or type of weapons his military possesed. all he would have needed to do was instruct a few terrorist thugs to find a way to attack us. isn't that what the taliban did? no wmd's or for that matter even conventional military weaponry was required for the 9-11 attack.
notsarc,313,"i agree with... well heck, i agree with all of you pro-life people. killing someone in a coma and stabbing somone in the back when they're walking down the street are not any different in 'wrongness.' actually, if we had any pity left in our evil hearts, we would most likely find it harder to kill someone in a coma, because of the fact that they can't protect themselves or think! of course, if we had any pity, abortion wouldn't even be an issue. it is murder. if people can get the death penalty for murdering an grown person that is fully capable of defending themselves (at least, they used to get the death penalty), then why not a child that hasn't even breathed the air of this world yet? in my opinion, abortion should be illegal.  lovethesouth"
notsarc,314,"why? you seem to think you can come here and trash everyone else's religion and go on about how your religion is the 'true' religion and when someone else tries to tell how stupid your argument is, you tell them to stop making fun of it. and why do you care about how old people here are anyway?"
notsarc,315,"i fail to see why that matters. a beating heart does not make the creature a person. if you don't know the details, should you really be forcing your view on other people? since when does the ability to feel pain make something a part of your body? if it is numb is it any less a part of you?  heck, the fetus' brain isn't even developed enough to feel pain until at least the 3rd trimester (according to most scientists). will that make you change your stance on abortion? unlikely.  the fact that the 'unborn child' (makes me think 'undead corpse' whenever i see or type that) is receiving life-giving functions through the unbilical cord means that the creature on the other end gets to decide whether or not she will continue in the life-support function she is in."
notsarc,316,"my implication was that the christians felt they could not compete financialy so they vilified the jews in order to justify destroying them and taking there success. my question is how is that attitude any diffrent from todays ultra liberials that wish to uphold the inheritance tax, or property taxes? todays 'haves' are not nessacerialy all jewish, they are however being attacked by the 'havenots' for their success, much as the jews were back then."
notsarc,317,are you trying to say that people of faith cannot tell the difference between myth and reality? i'm actually confused by this sentence.
notsarc,318,"do you have any evidence of this that doean't come from a biased christian website? so here is where you are saying nanny, nannie, poo,poo my straight realtionship is better than your gay relationship. how? some big claims, can you provide some substance to them, in other words can you back this up with some data? that doesn't come from some christian baised study."
notsarc,319,"to the democratic party? http://slate.msn.com/id/2109218/ problems don't need to be identified, they are either for, or against the party... karl rove has shown us again, at least in his battles, that solutions and understanding take a back seat to ignorance. -mach"
notsarc,320,"if it were only based on religion, you'd have a point. only if your first point were true; and it isn't; and it doesn't include any concern for the philosophies of science and other biases that are being taught as science which scientific method does it mimic? your whole assumption is one version -v- another. this is a false idea of the pelthora of ideas that exist."
notsarc,321,"don't believe what exists montalban? contradictions? you're correct! what does obectivist circular reasoning have to do with your contradictory position? (hint: nothing, it's the latest fallacy of rambling off topic) stuck, no way out...lol, is that in the bible too? or, you could back up your claims and stop avoiding the questions! so that's your definition for non-material is??? montalban defines :non-material it's non-material you're right, that's a non-definition, not a definition. -mach"
notsarc,322,a lot of people are adopted... my science teacher was adopted. he had a successful military career that ended with him as a war planner helping to plan the gulf war... he had a successful chiropratic practice too. what you said is not so true. should he have been denied his life because of some emotional trama he might bave later in life? i don't think so.
notsarc,323,"you're assuming a need to reduce it because government, or a special interest, requests it. if enough people want it reduced, their demands of manufacturers and buying habits will reduce it. deemed by whom? the government, or a special interest? who cares about the species? the majority of individuals, or the government, or a special interest? if the majority doesn't consider them problems, then no solutions are necessary."
notsarc,324,"those religious individuals, namely christians who follow a christ who identified with the poor and oppressed. the jesus christ of empire, which is neither supported by scripture or history, is one of the idols that has been created in service of those who would attempt to drug the masses. to have an encounter with the spirit of christ, is to wake from a long slumber. minus this encounter, i too would be an atheist and subsequently a nihilist. i respect all people who have a sincere desire for truth. but, then what is truth? for the christian truth begins and ends with god as manifested in the person of jesus christ. so, what does that mean? good question."
notsarc,325,"what extended family interference? even mass same-sex marriages can't get ss benefits. you should research joint tenants in common becasue that isn't true that isn't a gaornment decision. that is a business decision. businesses can decide to allow it if they want to, so marriage wouldn't change that. i'm saying what can't you do without it. not about marriages in mass. also the federal government wouldn't recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act. so far you haven't named one yet. also as couples you don't have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen.  calling me full of **** while i just showed you have you're wrong.. funny."
notsarc,326,in the old testament people were punished for the sins they committed. i think he's asking why should we punish people while they are living? god will punish them when they die.
notsarc,327,she is an attractive woman. what was she doing witha 14 yr old? she could probably walk into any local club or bar and pick up the man of her choosing.  does she have a specific thing for kids? will she do it again with another kid once this one grows up? if so she is a predetor. of coarse several hundred years ago kids of this age married and fornicated as part of everyday life. is our society that different than is was then?  i was a horn dog when i was 14. or at least wanted to be.
notsarc,328,when did mike moore do that? how about in bowling for columbine when he portrayed chuck heston. here is the scene: 1) cut to heston wearing a dark suit. 2) cut to crying children outside columbine high school. 3) cut to heston saying 'from my cold dead hands.' case in point. both portions of the speech were not in dever nor were they about columbine. i got another quote from mike moore. 'fu** the poor' - mike moore. i put that together after a class in the mike moore school of movie editining 101.
notsarc,329,so snakespit. let me ask you a question? two mike moores? one with a gun and one without? one from musgeon has a gun. the one from flint does not? put both in the same situtation. a criminal jumps over the counter to attack mike moore. which one lives?  which one dies? which one lives unhurt? which one lives with broken facial bones?
notsarc,330,"and how is it a red herring? bearing in mind that forcing one person to harm themselves physically for another is illegal in the us, it's illogical to make this rule apply only to pregnant women. as pregnancy is always harmful, the woman cannot be forced by law to go through it even if you think a zef is a baby."
notsarc,331,"an innocent person can be convicted of a crime--i thought that was what the topic was about. just because they are convicted, doesn't mean they are 100% responsible, guilty, etc for that crime-but if they are convicted then in the eyes of the judicial system--they are guilty. that is why these innocent people are put in prison for 20 years--they are convicted of a crime. i was trying to say that with dna used in forensics, then maybe the dna study blood stain other than the victims might save a person from going to prison on circumstantial evidence. okay, everytime i make a post i get my arse jumped on--what is it with you people? like i said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.  comprende' ?"
notsarc,332,"why didn't you think of it? it took me no time at all to find the actual article, who authored it, and how to contact them. from what i have seen of your post, you rarely think at all."
notsarc,333,propaganda?!! dou you make me sick! how can you see these and still make a jeer at these photos. have you know heart for sacrifise of human life? have you no cause? have you no heart!? my heart wrenched when i saw those and it angers me to see one who has been deluded by his own proclamed righteousness to still be better than human decency.
notsarc,334,"okay, my computer is too slow to go search some statistics and copy the url to try and defend my opinion; but, here is my opinion anyway. one reason there are so many crimes against women, or crimes in general, is that offenders are repeat offenders much of the time. how many times have you heard of a child molester being released from prison and repeating the crime? there is not much determent to crime when criminals are put in jail for a year and on their first parole hearing are released back on the street to repeat offenses. i don't know what the answer is --but i think that is the reason there are so many crimes, especially sex crimes."
notsarc,335,"have you been to one? our local catholic schools only require that you take a single religously oriented class and that you attend church twice a week, though they waive the churc requirement witha notef rom your parents. they will even waive the religous class requirement if asked. if you go to a public univerrsity, you are likely to be requred tot ake a comparative religon class, or a sociaology class which includes religous beliefs."
notsarc,336,"when you were asking this question, was it somewhat in reference to bill clinton? personally, i think that whole thing was blown out of proportion. is that the type of thing that you're saying should be investigated?"
notsarc,337,"i meant what i wrote. i was asking if the solution was to continually have sex, or never abstain. but others disagree with you. some say that the life doesn't start until birth. my question is what's wrong with killing? your quiz made it just so it said there wouldn't be a life so abortion is wrong. abstaining from sex does the same thing."
notsarc,338,what about evolution has been observed?  i think it has been more theorized (if thats a word) then anything else. creating theories for theories and so on.
notsarc,339,"so no one thinks we are headed for a collapse of society as we know it? historically, great, well-run and governed empires always collapsed after a time, usually from corruption from within (most likely for us if it happened), or outside conquest. are we the new golden-age? -mach"

notsarc,341,"actually i just copied yours. :p i just figured with your past history, you actually did the digging to find the real stuff, unlike many religious people who just preach the same church made up claims. however, hunter has some internal contridictions in his arguments, and does seem to skirt issues when it becomes cumbersome to deal with them.  why do you say that? law is not concerned with preaching love. law is concered with preaching order. singapore is a draconian state, and look how successful they are economically and culturally."
notsarc,342,what religion would that be? atheists are almost all nonreligious and i don't see much buddhism being taught in schools.
notsarc,343,[quote=mae] land that didn't belong to the un or israel. or current american aggression? what's the difference? both are imposing their ideologies by force. you make it sound like choosing a sports team; for or against based on personal opinion.
notsarc,344,"you must be joking. i'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane. then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the us? if what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the us, but we don't."
notsarc,345,"your logic here really scares me. if his actions werent intrinisicly wrong, i guess there is no absolute that we are morally right to judge him. thats according to you.. and by the way, where did your mother get those convictions from?? and beyond.. there is something in every human heart that knows murder is wrong, stealing is wrong, and so forth. who created that is what i wanna know.."
notsarc,346,"perhaps, perhaps not. that doesn't have anything to do with that the argument that she provided was not prochoice. why should i? she has not made that claim to me. you have, though, so i am pointing out to you that while she may support abortions, the argument you copied is not about prochoice."
notsarc,347,"but they don't enforce it very well at all. before the season they can only test 5% of the players max, and during the season, once you've been tested you can't be tested for the rest of the season. i mean if the teacher left the room during the sat's, do you honestly expect everyone to sit there and not cheat, when doing well can help them get a better standing in life? steroids is just an extreme. you pay a bigger price for it, but you also get better results."
notsarc,348,"no offense, but that is a sick way to think about something. glad to know we can put a price on a life. when ones values money over life we have a serious problem in this country. it really goes against everything we stand for. one cannot be free if they are controlled by money. i happen to think that everyone is equal....everyone....mentally retarded, no legs, one eye, anything. for one to say that the cure for disease is death...this is just sick, makes you wonder what we value these days...money or life? even if you were just about the money, a culture of selfishness will make the economy worse then a culture of selflessness. do we really need to get into historical examples of nations that became too selfish? the end is not pretty."
notsarc,349,"are you saying you only have a hard time having compassion for the gay victims of sexually transmitted illness? if, so that just shows your anti-gay prejudice. what difference does that make? everyone who has aids is a victim. in some communities and in other countries, the majority who have it are straight. against the victims from the largest social group of victims in each jurisdiction? this is nothing more than prejudice and destructive political agenda.  i would hope there are other, better, human instincts inside of you."

notsarc,352,"yet everything in that site is cited with sources such as cnn and what not. i understnad the florida right to life is not credible to our discussion(as they are not neutral) however the things they cite are...and that is what you should look at. so murder is a subjective term now...i laugh at that. your point was what again? they fact that vor didn't prove his case and never does? i don't understand....however, maybe if you looked at the sources on that site you would see that it is in the upper 90%s (however this is clinical abortions...not underground ones)."
notsarc,353,"if your faith would prevail over the rule of law then yes it is objectionable. if the judges of concern would follow their faith more then laws of the nation he should not be confirmed.  would a strict muslim who would push islamic beliefs into his judgements be allowed? or a hindu? given that the answer is a no, neither should a strict christian."
notsarc,354,assumption of 'millions'. they must of because how else can we account for the species today ? got any support for this ? i can prove the antidiluvians knew about and used pi. if man began as an ape/animal then how do you explain the fact that pi was not discovered until thousands of years later ? ray m.
notsarc,355,"is it sad? or is it true? if you are going to support discrimination against a group of people, needless discrimination, how can you spin that as being anything but bigotted?  marriage is a personal thing. who we wish to share our lives with, be intimate with, confide or deepest fears to is not a matter of for the public to decide. the majority has no role here. nor should the majority, without a clear state or public interest, decide for the individual what marriage is or who one can marry. and one certainly should be allowed to treat homosexuals any differently before the law than hetrosexuals.  if a persons says they should be discriminated against, it is fair to suggest they are perhaps biggotted or homophobic."
notsarc,356,"sorry bob, i just don't have that super-flux-retentive-memory that allows you gay people to remember all the way back to the moment of exiting the birth canal. guess i'll never know for sure what my 'sexual orientation' was when i was born, but from the time i can remember i've been straight. as far as i'm concerned, i'm content saying that sexual orientation really becomes a matter of identity at puberty. fair enough, i'm not going to argue with you over that. as a parent who has had toddlers, it's awfully hard for me to imagine being able to ascertain something like that at such a young age, but who knows? i was just taking issue with the idea that anyone could possibly truly know they were gay at birth."
notsarc,357,"correct. did you notice that in the scott peterson trial, the judge went around the law in deciding how he should be punished and who has rights? a clear sign of activism, yet none of the righties called him a activist judge even when what he did is by defintion activism. it's a sign they are hugely hypocritical.  vor's got a raging double standard if he calls some judges who do that activist and others who do the same, not."
notsarc,358,"you thought wrong then. for the same reason the jury is still out on the theory of gravity. in reality the jury isn't out in either case. evolution (and gravity) have been demonstrated - beyond all sensible and reasonable doubt - to be fact. this has been explained to you many times before. theory is as good as it gets in science. sciences cannot be proven impirically. no amount of evidence for a scientific theory ever proves it.  prove in what sense? if you are after a simple court type 'proven beyond reasonable doubt', it's been proven already. if you want mathematical proof, then you will wait forever. it's in the bottles of whiskey in your local bar."
notsarc,359,"didn't texas sign it into law a while back that if 3 or more people can identify you as the one who committed the crime that you get no appeals, and go right to the top of the list to be executed? i think this should be the case in every state. while many cases do deserve appeal, many do not. if we got rid of appeals cases on indisputable crimes, we would save quite a bit of taxpayer money."
notsarc,360,so what you're saying is that you can't?  as a political move to satisfy the pro-life constituents that put them in office.
notsarc,361,"where did i 'bitch' about kinds? please quote the post or withdraw the comment. a clue for you: i've never discussed kinds with you, so just apologise and we can move on, eh?"
notsarc,362,"oh please, you have got to be joking. where are you pulling this from? a 'severe retraction of the money supply' causes inflation? it isn't a 'historically founded assumption' or a 'mathematical' certainty, and to deny it is virtually to deny all economics. supply and demand determine price. i care, because the purchasing power of that money correspondingly declines. if you think the government printing currency and spending it does not cause the value of all other currency in circulation to decline, the same must apply to private citizens. why don't we just issue a printing press to every american, then they can all have as much money as they want. you are twisting yourself in a knot trying to justify this lunacy you originally wrote: then ["
notsarc,363,"you choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a 'primitive land': i neither said nor intended to imply as much. try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. british imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. it had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. english happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. i don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. do you ? it's obvious that other languages have an input: i'm not making a judgement about them."
notsarc,364,then what did you mention? compensation against stolen goods is insurance against theft.
notsarc,365,"are uk mortgages packaged and peddled as securities as in the us? if so, is that (those) a government or quasi-government agency(s)? i ask to see where the eventual fallout will take place. the uk is much like the us in that when consumers default there's always a substantial amount of private money waiting for those adjustments to buy at the bottom for future resale. if they are in fact packaged, the security holders will have to write down their investments and defaults by the end of their fiscal year, normally determining the length of that cycle. we follow many of your economic cycles but i've never watched your residential real estate market. brown would have a tough time pulling that one out of the fire."
notsarc,366,"hell yes! but that is hardly the only reason. why do you think there was so much hand wringing over the assasination of jfk? the belief on many people was that the soviets had done this and they wanted to get on record immediately that they had nothing to do with it. a lot of people were afraid we were about to go into wwiii with all of the bombs going off. i should know. i was in the military during that time and things got very dicey.  btw, the news is now reporting an evacuation of the wh and capitol building because an airplane has entered restricted air place, within three miles of the capitol. fighter planes were sent to intercept. news just now coming in. probably nothing serious."
notsarc,367,too late. have you stepped foot on a politically correct college campus recently? the former bastions of free speech are worse than almost anywhere else in the us now. emoticonxmad
notsarc,368,about as much 'soverienty' legitimation as hitler had when he was butchering the jews. no cause? you forget about trying to murder bush #41. no cause? you forget about him funding palestinian terrorists at $25k a pop. no cause? you forget about invading kuwait. no cause? he kicked out the u.n. inspectors. no cause? he fired at our airplanes who patrolled the no-fly zones. no cause? the mass graves and stalinist government? and these are just the things we know for certain.
notsarc,369,"so you argue that for some women, abortion is the 'easy way out', and that those women choose to abort, take the easy way out as you say, for arbitrary reasons? could you please reiterate these reasons here (preferably in an enumerated list) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary? indeed. but we've established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents.  so i'll repeat the question, hearsay aside, upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants?"
notsarc,370,"oh, and i did see your impressive list in the other thread justinecredible. if i had seen it before i started this thread i wouldn't have started it. i had no idea there were that many hypocritical anti-gay republicans. that list really does make it look like all the really adimant opposers of gay rights are in fact closet gays themselves. i wonder if any of these guys chose to be gay. oh, for those interested in the list, can you link to it, please? i tried to find it again, but i can't. mille grazi!"
notsarc,371,walking-fish: has anyone ever observed two atoms combining to form a molecule? has anyone ever counted out 6.02 x 10^23 molecules to see if they really make up a mole? has anyone ever watched the earth for a year from outer space to see if it really does go around the sun? has anyone ever seen electrons in a copper wire when an eletric current is passed through it? all scientific disciplines are held together by theories which are inferences about things we cannot directly observe. what is it about science that you don't understand?

notsarc,373,"yes, it happened through mutation. what do you mean by 'what sort'? i assume you're looking for something more in depth than 'the genetic sort'. i'm afraid i can't rattle off the difference in the sequences if that's what you want. if that's not what you want than you'll have to ask a more specific question."
notsarc,374,obviously i don't have a perfect memory or even that i read what you are referring to. why don't you give me a flavor of their 'factual errors?' and are you talking about their news sections or their opinion pieces? and who wrote it? sometimes in the opinion pieces these are submitted by authors in the nations that are the subject. perhaps this was written by a swedish politician who had an ax to grind.
notsarc,375,"your example is kinda hard to relate however i see your point. you would think they would only make it the cost of the abortion if that is what the male wanted...however, maybe only half of it? i dunno...kind of a weird question. i will think about it more :)"
notsarc,376,"that is a specious argument. the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do, but of what is of value in a free society. the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character. ideas for laws come from morality? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved. so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life?"
notsarc,377,"oh really? what are the tests for 'i.d.'? you have not showed any of those. you have made lots of claims. for example , you made claims about the reduction of the atmosphere.. and i countered with some explainations. here are some peer reviewed scientific articles on it "
notsarc,378,[quote=voice of reason] tell me; exactly how do i think ? don't speak of people you donot even know.
notsarc,379,"i totally agree that it should be more like the organ donor system, though i think a lot of the controversy arises where families of patients have signed away more than they thought (as was the case in the uk, it was legal because the families had actually allowed it not really thinking about it). having never been in the situation (and hopefully never either), i have no idea how confusing or misleading (not intentionally, i think its due to there being a standard question like 'do you mind if parts of the body are used for transplants or research?', only in extreme cases will their be a problem) i don't know who's really to blame. however to ban it completely, especially if its mainly due to a misunderstanding of policy or options i would see as worse. but yes, it should certainly be like organ donation."
notsarc,380,"catholics who practice what? i made no mention of any practices in post. indeed, yet you do not condemn contraception as the church demands. likewise you supported desert storm ii, which the vatican officially condemned."
notsarc,381,"should we clear up what we're talking about at all? i think adultery is legal in 24 states, and i'm pretty sure adultery laws have been pretty much completely unenforced since world war ii. i don't know of any states where a polygamous relationship with no marriage involved is illegal. now, certainly having multiple marriage licenses is illegal..."
notsarc,382,and the other two...? 'political disorder and confusion' is not the same as personal 'disorder and confusion'.
notsarc,383,"why convince me of something i already know? however, the homosexual community does have more of a problem..just like africa has more of a problem then the us."

notsarc,387,did he? what secular evidence do you have from before 70 c.e. that confirms his existance? what is the outside verification to the new testament?
notsarc,388,"i don't understand this one..region and majority? what are you referring to. i don't recall saying anything about dna in the last 4-5 posts however, a human life is more important to me then a dog...yes. it is to you too. so why don't you tell me why?"
notsarc,389,"first of all, i never stated that any medical procedures should be outlawed. you jumped to conclusions. secondly, why are you throwing around the word need like that? in the very few cases (2.8%) where the mother's life may be in jeopardy from the pregnancy, she will need an operation. all other elective abortions are a want. so a woman would never have to go to a quack or butcher for an operation that she needed, if it was illegal for all other elective abortions."
notsarc,390,"was it a 'sexual based movement', as you've called it, then, or a civil rights movement? those opposed at the time, would have more than likely saw it essentially as a 'sexual based movement', led by people who didn't want to stay in the closet about their sexuality."
notsarc,391,exactly my point. how far back do we go ? there has to be a statute of limitations . how about compensating people who actually suffered the injustice? compensating the descendants of slaves.....that is going to be tricky.... some descendants have mixed black/white heritage....who decides if they are entitled to compensation or not ? compensating descendants opens up a can of worms.
notsarc,392,"so wouldn't that cover almost all of africa? there are so many people dying in the city streets of hunger in our own country, yet we elect a president who wants to address a problem in iraq rather than our own country? if we truly tried to help all those less fortunate than ourselves, we would be helping africa a lot more than we are now (their average life expectancy is like 30). yes iraq was terrible, but guess what, other countries might think our country is terrible. that is not our concern and at least we could wait until we fixed all of our own problems first. we have poor hungry starving people on the streets of the us and we go to another country to solve their problems?"
notsarc,393,"i simply quoted to you your own scripture, ez. how is that construed as bashing? de 21:20-21 and they shall say unto the elders of his city, this our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die:  mr 16:17-18 and these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
notsarc,394,the iranian govenment was visibly anti-american. did the filipino and dutch cases have that component? i am still quite convinced that americans would hate iran just as much as they accidentally caused american casualities.
notsarc,395,"i too am impressed by detrean's post. is he not an example to the likely solution though? as growing numbers of people in america get sick of this bickering between two extreme groups, they will look to centre-ground polititians with a tolerance of differing views to fill the void and provide an alternative form of government. it might not be a slow process either. there was an interesting article in the observer newspaper (a british left-wing sunday paper) that suggests this backlash may even happen during this presidency (http://observer.guardian.co.uk/inter...514898,00.html)"
notsarc,396,"ok, but a government can't grant benefits/priviledges based on statistical likelihood of an action. blacks are far more likely to be incarcerated than whites, does that mean we can premptively throw them all in jail? no, we create responses based on what people actually do. thus, if a heterosexual or homosexual decides to have children, they should get a tax credit for it. or you can go the reverse, that every married couple gets a tax credit, regardless of whether they have children or not (my personal advocacy). but granted benefits based on statistics is absurdly unfair, if only because people deserve to be treated as individuals, not numbers."
notsarc,397,"can you back up this claim that cancer is spreading? no. evolution isn't 'supposed' to do anything. stuff changes, life goes on. could you transalate this into english please?"
notsarc,398,which will push crude oil prices up in line with the benchmark usd devaluation? treasury interest rates could become interesting. i'm already seeing conventional cd and money market rates on the rise.
notsarc,399,"where is here? you don't seem to want to display your location. we all know there's more than one way to become an american citizen. that said, as an american citizen, english is the native tongue. it's the primary language taught in american schools and it's how our government communicates with its citizenry. i'm not really interested in debating this topic with you, it probably should be a thread unto itself. i think dono was merely pointing out that if you want to make a 'snippy' reply, it carries more weight when correctly spelled."
notsarc,400,"i think that would probably create more problems than it would solve. how would we know? we don't punish. drunk drivers get off incredibly easy so much of the time. we have the weakest anti-drunk driving laws in the western world and we have the worst problem with drunk driving. coincidence? that's not all that far from what i've said. @joe- this is for a whole other discussion, but i think that the first step in aa is a big part of the reason of its low success rate. that's not too far from what i've said either."
notsarc,401,"plenty!! let's start with the buffalo teachers' federation. they are unwilling to switch to a single health care provider from three providers. this, in turn, will lead to further layoffs in the buffalo public school district. how about bethlehem steel? once the largest employer in lackawanna, unreasonable demands for over $20-25/hr salary increases in an industry that was struggling to survive? come on! unions do more harm to business and municipalities than you think!!!"
notsarc,402,"why can't skeptics be reactionary? don't you know people who automatically distrust everything said by bush, or by liberals, or any group you like? why should skeptics be any more objective than the average population? some will be very objective, some will be very reactionary, most will fill in the spectrum in between. i belive that the majority are in the middle, you seem to be focusing on the reactionary end."
notsarc,403,"if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep."
notsarc,404,"'if it's beside the point' the why bring it up, jyoshu. why 'talk out of both sides of your mouth'?  and your right wing talking points are stale and tired. comparing different civil rights movements is not 'piggybacking'. and incidentally, why is it that all of the blacks in congress for equal rights for glbt people? why is it that they are the most passionate defenders of glbt people? there are black gay people who suffered along with the straight black people. there are female gay people that suffered along with the women. on top of such discrimination, gay people may have had no family support. some were probably lobotomized against their wishes. some were raped, some were probably murdered by people they thought would understand what discrimination was all about. no, my friend. it is disingenuous to say with certainty that you know they have not."
notsarc,405,i think you may be very very suprised by roberts. i like some of the answers he is giving. i have a feeling you conservates may get f***cked. he is not as conservate as you think. besides even if he is conservate he certainly is not as conservate as the emoticonxcensored he is replacing.  as a citizen of virginia do you support this law that strips people of their wills and powers of attorny? http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp...41+ful+hb751s1 this is just a very mean law and will hurt many people.
notsarc,406,and you believe that to be what? you really need to just say who/what you think the creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.
notsarc,407,why is being christian seen as being 'conservative'? surely there are plenty of jewish and muslim conservatives. i've known some indian hindus (is there any other kind?) that were very conservative. what if there was a hindu organization that taught or espoused conservative values?  would they make these people's list? i doubt it.
notsarc,408,"pay attention. age of consent is still the topic and point. if teen pregnancy is reduced to statistically acceptable levels through education and contraception with medical risk being a negligible five-decimal point factor, that would position teen sex emotional distress as a good/bad societal interpretation designated by non-teens, would it not? which would negate chronological age of consent for legal sex to a non-status unless those non-teens making the laws had another agenda."
notsarc,409,"howard, i didn't ask who jesus believed or said he was. i'm asking you who you say jesus is? this is basic confession of christ. jesus even asked his disciples. who do you say jesus christ is? the long awaited jewish messiah? your resurrected savior for the remission of your sins? the great god and savior (2 peter 1:1)? simple yes's or no's will suffice."

notsarc,411,"ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?"
notsarc,412,"let me guess - you also believe that moses wrote the torah, wherein he describes his own death and burial? 'wild theory'? i suggest you do an internet search on the synoptic problem and the related two-source theory.  why do you demand that which you know cannot be produced? no, we don't have the q source, but we have evidence which points to a q source. likewise, we have a great deal of evidence which suggests that the torah had multiple authors."
notsarc,413,"i totally agree. you never know what you might pick up. but he likes to eat hey? that's weird. but to each his own. i like to eat more normal food myself. but if you explore certain sides of someones personality, do you really learn anything? how do you know you just don't watch and then five minutest after you explore the personality, you forgot everything about that person. i mean, i don't know, but i have some trouble picking up on personalities right away of people i meet. has anyone ever tried spilling tuna on the floor on purpose? i'm just wondering because that would be weird."
notsarc,414,"no, god doesn't force the murderer to murder his victim, but god knew that it would happen and it did happen for a reason known to god. god allows it to happen because he does not interfere with free will. how can it not be part of god's plan? his plan does not just include people free of sin, because we have all sinned. his plan includes sinners as well."
notsarc,415,do you think banning guns would stop people who wanted them from getting them? also you failed to address my point. is self-defense not a legitimate use for guns?

notsarc,421,an infant isn't capable of living on its own even after being delivered. what level of support differentiates 'developed enough' from not developed enough? the age in which a premature baby can be kept alive is down in the 5 1/2 month range now and will likely drop further as science continues to progress. so is the distinction that you make based on today's science or something eelse?
notsarc,422,"ephesians does indeed talk of salvation through faith created in christ jesus unto good works(2:10). i must admit that im not totally sure what this means, that faith leads to good works? id dispute that. whilst most of romans does talk of salvation through faith, romans 2:6 says however god will render to every man according to his deeds. in the end, the point is moot. i dont really care if the bible does say that man is justified by faith alone (and it doesnt conclusively), my point is that i am unwilling to worship a creature that justifies only by faith anyway."

notsarc,424,"third degree? dono posted something that confused me, so i was asking for clarification. of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry? adopt? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up, for that matter? why should anyone care whether women have abortions, as well? again, where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession? yay for you? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine, too, so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking."
notsarc,425,"do you believe the average individual actually has any personal control over providing basic essentials and security? most individuals exist from proceeds of a 'job' or government programs and would be lost without one or the other, of which they generally have no actual influence.  i find it difficult to accept that the average, individual us citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what's on tv. voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit."
notsarc,426,"no, i don't admit it - i don't know what your definition of 'scientest' is. dictionary.com defines one like this; i guess i need your opinion of what 'expert knowledge' is. does your 'scientest' have to be on the public payroll? does micheal behe not fit the bill for you? many people consider id to be a valid scientific theory. why is that not good enough for you? must we have only the intelligensia make our decisions for us? how familiar are you with the us constitution?"

notsarc,438,"but what about the many cases where that sort of thing doesn't happen? do you really think that every case of someone finding out a person is involved in the homosexual way of life results in being kicked out of a home, church, or job? the problem with your view is that it has no room for people who disagree but don't do these things you say. and that happens all the time."
notsarc,439,"so do you think before you speak? abraham left mesopotamia, modern day iraq, for canaan to start a new religion. so where did he start the religion? canaan, modern day israel.  and yes i know that there is much more to the bible and my point was that you can't believe the bible 100 percent world for world or you would be contradicting yourself."
notsarc,440,i concede that it can go to a ballot. you have been arguing that such an issue should go to a ballot.  care to comment on the second point i made? to some extent this thread is about whether anyone should be concerned that all the petition signers realized what they were signing (in the context of proven wide-spread fraud on the part of the signature gatherers).
notsarc,441,"well, can you prove that the adhernents of 'humanism' use it with ardor and faith? nope. it is a philophy though.. on the ethical manner on how to treat your fellow man. that last one, you could have 'republicanism', or 'being a political red neck' to be a religion."
notsarc,442,[quote=aussieseek.com] so to all the posters here i ask the question. why are you in favour of people with mental problems owning guns.? [quote] that is one heck of an assertion for a newbie. why do you assume we are in favor of that? i do not see anyone saying that. ef
notsarc,443,"so if you were starving to death would you steal a loaf of bread? morals depend on the situation you are in. if teachers were to teach them, they would not be taught as such. teachers would say 'don't steal', but they won't say 'don't steal unless you need to do so to survive, or need to save another's life, or....' morals would be taught as absolute rules, rather than relative ones. this is the problem with teaching them. my personal stance on morals is basically that others should be treated with respect and how you would want to be treated by them. but i would not necessarily extent this respect to someone who i knew had acted immorally. we are actually debating whether it is morally right for teachers to teach morals :)"
notsarc,444,"what did sanger say specifically that leads you to this conclusion? the preceding is from wikipedia. now, perchance, does 'cleaner' possibly mean having been exposed to enough medical information to be aware of veneral diseases so as to know how to avoid them? do you have an aversion to accurate information about stds being available?"
notsarc,445,"based on what? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe. surely, 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it didn't.  you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions...not whether people were having them or not."
notsarc,446,"have you ever had strawberries? blueberries? raspberries? oranges? grapefruits? i can't name quite as many vegetables that i think are good, but you get the point. there are many fruits that at least in my opinion beat the junk food in cafeterias any day. how about some real meat? you like cheese? you like ham? turkey? roast beef? salami? i'm sure i'm missing some but you can make a very good sandwhich with any of these. along with this i don't think it would hurt much to have something like a candy bar as well. i usually have: ham and cheese sandwhich, muffin, a fruit, a vegetable, crackers or something like that, a desert of some kind (candy bar, cookies, etc.). still tastes good, but it is a lot healthier than the school lunches (and in my opinion tastes better too)."
notsarc,447,"there is plenty of evidence on what kind of marriage the clintons have. i am not making this up out of whole cloth, i am referring to the jr. senator's own words in her memoir 'living history': hillary rodham clinton felt 'dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged' when she learned of the affair and said that she could 'hardly breathe' when she learned the rumors of the affair were true. 'gulping for air, i started crying and yelling at him: 'what do you mean? why did you lie to me?' mrs clinton writes.  doesn't sound like such a swingin good time ey what? but don't take my word for it, go down to the library and read pg 502.  i stand by my previous thesis."
notsarc,448,how exactly is terrorism not a criminal act? i don't see what you're getting at.
notsarc,449,"here's the thing about stem cell research... how would stem cell research go against the christian faith. does it go against christ to heal the sick? medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research. i'll quicky mention 2 people (1 still alive and one dead) who could have (or could be) greatly healed with stem cell research. for one, christerpher reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done. michael j. fox (and others with parkingson's (sp?) disease) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research. oh, and one other thing. bush has no family values. not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families. he sends husbands/fathers, wives/mother's, sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway."
notsarc,450,did you read the artical? to show our children that they are no different then any other.
notsarc,451,"perhaps. but which would you rather have: promiscuity without protection or with? the distinction can matter, so if there is going to be promiscuity going on, i for one would perfer to see it be safe-sex, as much as possible. but even better would be if a person not being promiscuous at all, imo anyway."
notsarc,452,"if the distinction matters, then what is your point about promiscuity, exactly? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with, that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease. that is not true. it just takes one time with an infected person. protection is what people should be arguing. it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality, upfront about their hiv status, and used protection at all times during sex."
notsarc,453,"well, if one must make a choice, then let's make the question more pertinent to this discussion. from a public health perspective regarding aids, which would be better: all sex outside a momogamous relationship between tested individual protected, whether promiscuous or not or only promiscuous sex protected and non-promiscuous sex unprotected? (leaving aside a common definition of 'promiscuous' -- you use your mysterious definition, i'll use mine.) i'd vote for the former. you? well, if you want gay people to be less promiscuous (still without a determined definition), support our full integration into the larger culture and stop calling us immoral. in the long run, we'll end up acting just as randy -- or not -- as anyone else."
notsarc,454,"is this what jpsartre meant? at any rate, to say that there were large numbers of gay men, being infected in the u.s., is not saying there is a connection between aids or its spread and homosexuality in itself. there is a connection when there is active sexuality, gay or straight, and aids is a sexually transmitted disease. we actually don't know who patient zero was. what is the point of saying initially it affected much larger numbers of gay men, and fewer heterosexuals, to the best of our available knowledge? this is a disease, and unknowingly spreading it, no matter who you are, is not murder. the fact that much more transmission was initially occuring in a certain group, who had sex among that group, before that group knew it existed and what it was and how to prevent it; that would also not be murder."
notsarc,455,"i'm sorry, but i find this completely ridiculous and unfounded. i can see (remotely) how abortion might be considered anti-woman (although it is of course anti-life before being anything else), but how has christianity directly sanctioned the questions of women's suffrage, spousal abuse, property ownership, social status, etc.? by the way, do you consider fundamentalists to be the best representatives of a religion? i am catholic, and i believe i understand the dogmas and principles of my faith quite enougth to say that nothing of what you have mentioned (except abortion, because it has nothing to do with women's rights) are viewed positively by the catholic church, or ever have been. please explain with details."
notsarc,456,"we could make this a little contest i suppose and see who gets the most right. for the primary categories anyway. picture, acting, directing, writing, any others? also definitely say what you think will, and what you think should."
notsarc,457,"if i recall correctly, many of the fires were started at about the same time, so more than one person seems likely. and weren't they mostly black churches that have been targeted? i wouldn't discount racism as the motive."
notsarc,458,i prefer to just pop out the cards rather than fool with the cords. i keep a usb cord plugged in and handy right under my monitor. i'm thinking of getting one of those mini card readers and then i won't even have to hunt around for a usb port.  i'll have to check the one you mention above. i don't need a professional quality one but one that is easy to use and i can snap something that doesn't require me to get out the manual to figure out. is it easy to use? about how much would that cost me? my 3.1 is ok but not as clear as i would like.
notsarc,459,"how does making 'the woman's responsibility' solve anything? some women have irregular periods or take contraceptive pills (which sometimes fail) that stop them having periods. i agree it is not the norm, but it is hardly unheard of. there have been recorded cases of people not knowing until the birth."
notsarc,460,"thats how you make it a federal issue...or in this case a constitutional federal issue. what on earth are you quoting? we only have 7 articles in the us constitution. i never said heterosexual marriage is a protected right..in fact, i said the opposite. the right to marry is not a constitutional right. i don't know...i think maybe 'activist' is a bad word to use now....i think 'constituional revisionist' is a better fit. you haven't even quoted the us constitution where it says marriage is a protected right. i am not even in the majority...so i don't see what your arguement is. you are just another person trying to relate political parties to different ways to interupt the constitution. i talk the 'your personal views dont belong in judging' view. this doesn't follow a conservative nor a liberal viewpoint."
notsarc,461,why don't they just ask the teachers? that's what the teachers are there for after all. -wez
notsarc,462,"so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?"
notsarc,463,"obviously you have that right, just as others have a right to vote to re-institute slavery. i'm not even talking about voting, i'm talking about this debate. why do you care if gays call their relationship marriage or not? if i don't know anything about you, please tell me how this does effect you (you imply that it does)."
notsarc,464,"could you clarify the italicized sentence for me, please? i don't understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not. if so, why?thanks...monday morning fogginess."
notsarc,465,why not? people that support abortion hold the view that the woman is more important than the unborn. if you rank humans and force something upon a certain group in one case why wouldn't you approve of it in another? eugenics is just saying a certain group of citizens is below another...kinda like an unborn is below a female...and then saying 'we are going to make sure you don't reproduce and we will put you in this home'...with abortion you just kill the person. atleast sanger took her views to the only logical conclusion.
notsarc,466,if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1st amendment. you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming 'free speech' is a right granted outside of the constitution. i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states. the case didn't deal with the first amendment at all. where did you get that idea from? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets. ok? was there ever any doubt that the 1st amendment was incorporated since cantwell?
notsarc,467,"who is the 'anyone' you're referring to? how many people in this administration have access to the highest level of intelligence necessary to make this assertion? when the president of the united states tells the american people he is invading another country because he has irrefutable evidence that they possess wmd's, i for one, expected to find proof they existed. maybe they should have said, 'we really think they have wmd's in iraq, it will cost about a trillion dollars to look for them, is everyone ok with this?'"
notsarc,468,"what? i have a guess as to what you meanby this, but its worded very oddly."
notsarc,469,"why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact? i am not talking about parenting. i don't advocate forcing anyone to parent. ever. that is why i support safe haven laws, signing away of parental rights, etc. i am talking about pregnancy. only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is. it is her body, not your's, not the state's, not the church's, and not the fetus'.  when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies/reproductive organs of women. i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent."
notsarc,470,listen if they can be nasty to me i can be equally nasty to them. what part of equailty do you not understand? equality one way or the other that is my over riding concern right and wrong are secondary.
notsarc,471,"not entirely sure whether you are agreeing with me or not:)  i also presume the reference to 'george' relates to the us president ?? if so then i'm afraid the one thing they have done is underestimate the terrorists and, then, in a way realising that, have gone over the top. apart from their fanaticism there is absolutely nothing to indicate that terrorists are anything other than just as capable of planning etc as any other man. indeed all their actions have indicated that they are extremely capable. we have to be more so"
notsarc,472,"that was a similar argument used for every single scientific discovery since the beginning of time. were is the biblical proof that god doesn't want cloning? those that said the earth was round instead of flat were labled heretics. many people believed flying should be left to the birds that god created. in fact, some faith's still believe that science is wrong, medicine is a sin. it is a good thing that we don't let religion dictate our science, or we'd still be thumping eachother with clubs and eating raw meat. pride caused the fall of the son of morning, not scientific discovery."
notsarc,473,"i can understand the gay couple adoption, but how does that fit with an unmarried man/woman situation? i'm not trying to give you a hard time. i'm only trying to understand the legal aspect of the relationships between you, your son and his new father.emoticonxconfused  again, congratulations. i've always believed that a father and mother were the best environment for a child to grow up with. emoticonxgood"
notsarc,474,"how is our wish and demands for equality forcing our views on you? how is my marriage to a man infringing upon you in any way? how is me being protected from being fired because i am gay infinging upon you in any way? how is my being able to adopt as a gay man infringing upon you in any way? we are asking for the same things heterosexuals take for granted every day. religious groups are trying to stop that equilaty drive by imposing their sick evil religious views though the law. if something effects my life it is being forced upon me if something does not effect your life it is not being forced on you. btw i am still waiting for a copy of this agenda. the religious tight christonazi oganizations, such as afa seem to believe there is one. please i want a copy."
notsarc,475,"how so? i would think 'they shall surely be put to death' (as the av has it) is a commandment, and clearly addressed to the faithful. how can one pick and choose what to take as a commandment and what is god, for want of a better way of putting it, talking to himself!"
notsarc,476,"they illegally invaded and are now illegally occupying land? that is a land feud. however, israel is there now and there is no turning back from them occupying that land. however as to that estimate of a 1000 to one thats a bit over the top and exagerated. i do agree with you that if israel went to withdraw to their *natural* borders they would still be attacked. however, israel isn't committing a genocide on the palestinian people, thats just an exageration. i could just as easily say the whole arab world is commiting a genocide on the israel people. but i don't say that. emoticonxangel  also i can see your point about the information given on areil sharon and hamas. however, the palestinians leaders have allowed terroist attacks for years and have been linked to many weapon trades. emoticonxkill"
notsarc,477,why are you trying to turn this into a religious debate? no one said anything about finding jesus. all you have done is show your anti-god prejudice.
notsarc,478,could you see language evolving in non social animals? it wouldnt have a reason to.
notsarc,479,"do we want to have control over ourselves? some religios fanatics dont, and thats what im saying. i dont know much on this matter, im only 14. but, ive been to a conservative catholic school, and ive seen what it's like. its a narrow minded hellhole."
notsarc,480,"hmmm, the employment, housing, and accommodation thing is really state based and for employment i am pretty sure every state doesn't allow you to ask about sexual orientation.  as for marriage...anyone is allowed to marry (so long as they are of age). you just have a problem with the definition of marriage. as for the military thing...seems like a complicated issue. where does a gay man shower for example? the womans bathroom? there own special bathroom? the mens bathroom? other issues involving relationships could arise as well. as for the adoption thing...only florida doesn't allow it outright."
notsarc,481,"where'd you find it? i've been wanting to listen to it, but wasn't able to find it from a google search."
notsarc,482,"hasn't every generation moaned about the younger generation? isn't that just a natural aspect of growing older? the current younger generation will do the same in due time, of course.

notsarc,483,"ok, so none can be shown. how many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?  my point being that a mistake doesn't make the sentence not worth having. in fact, with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence...there aren't many advocates for helping those guys out."
notsarc,484,"well if you could scientifically test for the supernatural, it wouldn't really be supernatural, would it? if some god or gods acted in ways that could be predicted and measured by scientific processes, it would be no different to any natural part of the universe."
notsarc,485,try and think about this then. you think the jury is going to be put under external influence to make an unbiased decision if firearms are in the court room. what other decision makers may have this problem if guns are allowed almost everywhere? the president? the senate? judges? don't expect that the jury can't be influenced either. the room cleaning service at their hotels will easily be able to have access to them if they wish and well armed of course.
notsarc,486,"d. adams? :)  this is, of course, an entire debate unto itself. i fully concede that logic dictates that we accept the possibility of life elsewhere. but that it's probable? we simply don't have the data to make that leap. we've got some good theories about how life started here, but we don't know exactly what happened. and even if we did, we don't know how common those conditions are 'out there'. if the conditions for life to arise are so bizarre that they only occur once every 20 billion years, and for all we know they might be, than we may well be the only life in the universe. logically, we just can't say. we don't have enough info to apply logic to the problem."

notsarc,488,"'compelling argument'? so do you believe the basis of what he's claiming? and are you ready to debate it? because there is no 'overall effect on society and traditional family' from gay marriage. the 'traditional family' has been having its own problems, and has been in decline in these countries long before gay marriage ever was legalized. it's like a guy jumping out of an airplane, and he starts falling to the ground. three seconds later gay marriage is legalized, and conservatives want to blame the fact that he's falling on gay marriage... it makes no sense. there is no causality here... do straight people say, 'hey! gay marriage is legal. i don't want to get married now.' do straight people say, 'hey! gay marriage is legal. i want to get a divorce now.' the 'most compelling argument' lacks any semblance of sense."
notsarc,489,"take a look at your post no. 80 time-stamped 6-26-06 09:55am wherein you said ...in response to my post #79 wherein i said: does that not comply with my claim that you change what i say? back in post #77, i requested that you quote and debunk the links. you merely scoffed at them (as i expected). prior to initiating any other question to me or introducing a tangential argument, please explain the above. i'll be back next week."
notsarc,490,"were they being slaughtered by their own before we pulled our little invasion stunt? no. true many of them were dying horribly under the weight of the sanctions that we were enforcing, but they were not being slaughtered by their own. we went in there, destabilized the country based on lies from our president, with no real plan for controlling the place once we worked our magic. we were actually stupid and arrogant enough (at least some of us) to believe that our system is so vastly superior to anything else in the world that the iraqis would just line up to be our unofficial 51st state. didn't work out that way.  now we find ourselves fighting on the side of the islamic fundamentalists against those who do not want to live in a country controlled by iran. worlds a funny place."
notsarc,491,"who said pregnancy is the only bad thing? we already talked about ceverical cancer. furthermore, condoms don't always work...bad protection. maybe not, but wearing a bright red sign that says 'stalk me' sure will get the ones that are out there. your limited world shield you from the realities of life...which is really a bad thing i suppose but it gives a better reason to listen to your parents. aren't you a warm-hearted person you are in cancun talking to people on a pointless forum... does anyone else think this is rather odd?"
notsarc,492,"the top 10% of people in this country pay 67% of the taxes. most of the money from the middle class? no, not at all."
notsarc,493,"it is more than the claimed evidence is questionable. it is that the evidennce that is claimed is not evidence of what is claimed. someone might take a snippet of fact or perception and see 'see, this is evdience of god'. however, it is not 'evidence of god' unless you assume god first.  i remember distinctly going out to a 'haunted' house with a friend. they pointed excitedly to the ghost they saw in the upstairs window. i had to point out to them, it wasn't ghsot at all, but rather it was the reflection of a street light. now, was that light in the window evidence of a ghost?? nope. was it claimed to be?? yep.  same thing with the 'evidence' for prayer causing the terminally ill to become healthy. it does not hold up to scruntiny."
notsarc,494,"really? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. you measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. in ten years you make actual measurements. the predictions of the first model for mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (for comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- i may be wrong about this). so, are you saying the first model is wrong? the error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). what about the second?"
notsarc,495,"backpedaling? how's that? my original answer is that it's wrong to force children to have sex with old men. that is my answer still. where has it changed? in fact, each post i've made is an affirmation of the one before it. how is that backpedaling? there are absolute goods and evils. that is, there are certain things that are good or bad. how is that saying something different? certain things are bad. period. just like certain things are wrong, no matter how many people think that they aren't wrong. period. is that clear enough for you? i hope so because that's what i've been saying all along and you'd have to be high to think i've changed my position."
notsarc,496,"no your question isn't about 'right to life', but more appropriate your questioned should be 'do they have a right to continue life'? and my answer is absolutely yes!  at the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is living, not dead. who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? no one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe."

notsarc,499,"well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort."
notsarc,500,"one idea per episode? there were always at least 4; one for each main character. and they always linked together perfectly. with the exception of a few episodes at the beginning and the last one, seinfeld was always gold.  the simpsons, on the other hand, has sucked for the last few years when they turned to the 'pick a celebrity guestspot' system."

notsarc,502,"if you want the benefits of marriage, get married. but you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice. your suggestion would be to marry someone i don't want to me married to, that is a different thing. it is not using 'that logic'. i thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you. isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities? i am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly. i happen to think that's a bad idea. people get married for many reasons, some of which i would feel are not good reasons, but i would not make it illegal to do so.  i am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing."
notsarc,503,"jito, you said that you have a 'fabulous kid.' is this how you would describe your pregnancy and his birth--as you do above? was it just another pee? was there no 'romance' or beauty or emotion or love involved? was it merely a biological occurence? if one cannot see the beauty and joy in love and babies and birth, i hope they will awaken to the wonders of the world. woman have many gifts. motherhood is a great one--the very powerful influence of shaping the future in our children. but yes, women are capable of much more. i have not said otherwise. my statements have been reduced to a perceived condescension. i will address more of your posts later."

notsarc,507,"if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his butt when he jumped. based on results paul had more influence. how can you simply ignore the obvious? christianity has hurt itself over and over again because of it's unwillingness to concede that sometimes it's wrong. how long did it take the church to acknowledge the earth moves around the sun or that the earth wasn't flat.  instead they either ignore the issue, bury it through violence or intimidation, or come up with some ridiculous idea that is based on nothing to justify why they are right."
notsarc,508,"can you think of the mental trauma of having your rapists baby? and then caring for it? for rape victims, no i still don't think abortion should be the first choice, but it should be available."
notsarc,509,"probably because the article is irrelevant. either way, i posted an article to make you happy so quit compaining and just answer the question with some respect. thanks for just simply answering dog....i'm not sure why it is so complicated. if you don't ask race than how can you be prejudice? there is also no proof that people would currently be discriminated against. but current affirmative action is a topic for another thread."
notsarc,510,"and you can thank the unions with their inflated wage/benefit packages they strongarmed from companies/municipalities for the high cost.  oh yes it is. new york is the only state where pbulic sector jobs, which bring little to no growth to an economy actually outpace the private sector. and you still think that heavy industry is the end-all be-all to economic survival?? america has a dynamic economy, not static."
notsarc,511,is homophobia an instinct? because i really have no clue where it came from...
notsarc,512,doesn't that depend on exactly what israel is doing? you can't treat the country as a whole in everything.  do i support some of their actions? no. do i oppose some of their actions? no.
notsarc,513,"you didn't prove anything. you just explained why it could be false or said it didn't matter. emoticonxrolleyes  'we've seen all of those things, and guess what, they weren't exactly as claimed. it was another american deception. another lie exposed.' how do you mean? i'm not aware of any deceptions thus far."
notsarc,514,separate but equal is never equal? which are better? boys' or girls' bathrooms? other than that last statement i agree 100%. i don't believe gay civil unions are separate but equal but i do believe they could be if we wanted them to be. unfortunately the people who seem to only be against redefining marriage and for civil unions never want to give gays all the rights of marriage in a civil union.
notsarc,515,"studies about what? that some people are more talented than others?  i'm afraid that falls under the umbrella of 'common knowledge'. so? it would change nothing, since i was pointing out why i responded the way i did."
notsarc,516,"another opinion- the sugar jar does symbolize the fetus, and the sugar the mental awareness. but just like people value their fine china. why is it that they cannot value something that is more valuable?! that is my point. another thing is this. why is it that you speak of a fetus that will never have mental awareness?! how would you know if you kill if before it can even develop mental awareness?!  also, i never said that i do not value someone who is not able to move. or think. where did you get that from?!"
notsarc,517,"is the legal aspect of it disputed or only whether it is immoral? i may be tooting my own horn, but this thread discussed the moral aspects of abortion in general, and this was my contribution. is that sort of what you're looking for?"
notsarc,518,"ya know what? this has inspired me to make a thread, hold on a sec."
notsarc,519,no one doubts the adjective sense of the word ;) and what is special about the human aspect? that was my question.
notsarc,520,"truth can be found in god. we as humans have a relative idea of what truth is because everyone will not agree on what is truth and what is not. for instance, one might say that europe will regain world power or that america will remain the world power but if everyone doesn't believe it how true is it? but universal truth can be considered aboslute such as math. 1 + 1 is 2, 12 inches equal a foot, etc. the question will remain to be unanswered until god reveals what truth is."
notsarc,521,"have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you? that he knows you? and that he cares about those in the womb? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded. you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity. this is why i argue so strongly against abortion. yet, any oppression, or insecurity, or hardship, or difficulty they face, though real and challenging, is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb. though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure. one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution--they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution."
notsarc,522,the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage is and always has been between members of the opposite sex. there may possibly have been some strange aberrations in the past but essentially that has always been the bottom line even for homosexuals. in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious grounds. and why shouldn't they if they so wish ? marriage is an institution not a right. if you don't qualify then you don't enter. by all means campaign to have the rules changed but don't be surprised if they aren't.
notsarc,523,"this assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. what says they have to be the same? this is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise.  yeah, that is correct."
notsarc,524,"this an example of what i am saying you choose to ignore the moral command from the ot to burn witches whereas in the middle ages that moral command was followed this passage also mentions that you must pay taxes as well, are you rebelling against god if you complain about the redistribution of wealth through taxation if it set by the governing authority ? i also believe that passage can cause all sorts of problems, for example a fascist regime is a governing authority should you submit to a government that is morally unjust ?  bad in general, and no i don't think the same. as i said i have started to modify my socialist principles, i have a great sympathy for the anarchist way of thinking. where the state is a way to oppress the masses."
notsarc,525,"what is this fsm? if it follows what god says, then it would be a suitable compromize, but i've never heard of this fsm."
notsarc,526,"but that doesn't answer the question. why is dawkins a xxxxx to believe as he does? it seems that you have no answer except to throw out indiscriminate insults at people you know nothing about. in a previous post you stated, 'the guys a simpleton.' that doesn't make sense as there is no verb in the sentence. 'guys' is the plural of 'guy'. you don't seem to be aware that the contraction for 'guy is' is 'guy's.' your error is caused by ignorance whereas trebor's is clearly a typo caused by the proximity of the 'e' and 'd' keys. do you have a better explanation for our origins that doesn't involve magic and dirt?"
notsarc,527,"by 'church' ... do you mean the group of people who are christian (ie. congregation) ? the institution of church? to orthodox, the church is a living earthly embodiment of jesus christ. the role of orthodox is to be like god... by following his example. we are called to return to him, but we are separated from him by sin. we are living icons of god."
notsarc,528,"so now it is not about nuclear weapons ? first of all you need provide a direct link that the iranian government are directly funding terrorist groups, you need to make sure it is not a private citizen or a rogue element in the secret service.  the perfectly analogy is the ira, us citizens gave shed loads of money to the ira. how would you have reacted if the uk bombed the us because the actions of a tiny minority of us citizens ?"
notsarc,529,"do you know what a fatwa is ? the burden of proof is on those who want an invasion, iran can not prove that is not trying to develop a nuclear weapon. you can not prove a negative. honestly i don't think people have learned the lesson from the iraq war.  what did we hear before that invasion from the warmongers in the us and uk ?  the exact same thing we are hearing at the moment. that the regime is evil, they have wmd, they have links to aq etc surely the people are not dumb enough to fall for the same tripe again ?"
notsarc,530,what do you find disrespectful about it? maybe it is 'disrespectful' but i sometimes that's not necessarily so bad. i don't think it rises to the level of being offensive.
notsarc,531,"look, it's a serious disease. i've never denied it was. there's no need to pursue which disease is more serious than another disease. hiv/aids is a treatable, uncurable, and potentially deadly epidemic. i don't understand what you point or solution is. i support taking multi-faceted approaches, recognizing that people are different, how they live is different. you repeat some of what i said in regards to that, then assume i mentioned it because i don't think it's important. you had a few negative comments on condom use earlier, saying it is not 100% effective(no way of having sex with another person is). are you suggesting only one, narrow approach that involves moralizing? i believe that would drive sexual practices underground. i also support needle-exchange programs for drug addicts, as part of harm reduction, by the way."
notsarc,532,"is free speech applicable to under aged individuals under the tuteledge and care of educators entrusted with their welfare and behavior? if so, why? they don't pay taxes, the add nothing to the gdp. who cares what they have to say?"
notsarc,533,"huh? emoticonxconfused  i think that you meant to say that she can't take down a sign that isn't on school ground. in this situation, the sign was across the street from the school property."
notsarc,534,"islam is no more built on hate, burder and death than christianity is. do i have to remind you of the inquisition, the holy land wars, the witch burnings, etc.? if you try to claim that what some islamic people have done represents the whole religion, then i can do the same with those things that i listed, only for the christian faith. and don't even get started again on satan being a fallen angel - yes, we know about your beliefs that angels do not have free will, and yet rebelled against god, so we don't need to go into any more of that garbage."
notsarc,535,"what? you didn't know that religious people are the only ones that are supposed to be silent and never try to take part in democracy, while everyone else gets to do so? where have you been? emoticonxdonno  i wonder sometimes if opponents of religion really even stop to think about what they're really saying."
notsarc,536,what's your opinion of religious people who believe evolution is merely a part of creation?  there are non-literal creationists out there in large numbers.
notsarc,537,"see there is such a thing as heterosexual privledge. some heterosexuals will do anything, or say anything to protect this privledge. for the christianist it is all about control, and money. the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control. take own own archangel, for example, in everyone of his posts he extols his religious beliefs and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian. one must ask themselves; why does he peach against something that does not personally effect his life? i have come to the conclusion that he is afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian."
notsarc,538,"it's already illegal to employ illegal aliens, so rather then create a fine structure i would guess you would want to increase it, or add on some jail time? right now the punishment for hiring illegals is clearly worth the risk. how do you propose renters make sure that their prospective tenants aren't illegal aliens? you can't expect everyone to lay their hands on their birth certificates, you can't ask for social security cards, and most other id's are sadly easy to get ahold of, not to mention not really proving citizenship. how do renters make sure that they only rent to those they're supposed to?"
notsarc,539,"get real! all christians are being painted with a broad brush of prejudice from the left. there are over what a billion christians in the world? how many are pedophile priests? how many protest funerals?  sorry, bad editing job on my part. i rewrote it for clarity and left out an important part. emoticonxbanghead i meant that 'islam', the religion that flogs or kills homosexuals, is given a pass from the left. i don't hear the left crying about the injustices towards gays by islam. instead, the left is obsessed with bashing christians, which are, for the most part 1million times more tolerant than muslims towards gays.  see correction above. don't ever get old, it screws with your mind. ;)"
notsarc,540,"no, i completely agree. it's frustrating from a woman's point of view also. does this mean that if a father and mother take their child out somewhere, it's solely the woman's responsibility to take care of the child? things should definitely be levelled when it comes to parenting."
notsarc,541,does everyone who is in nambla identify as gay? i really don't know.
notsarc,542,"i've been following the story here all afternoon bbs. i'm sorry that you're going through this, but what has scotland done to upset radical islam ? nothing that i know of. could it be they have declared war on the west in general and as a whole ? i mean, i have been told over and over again how these radical moslems are just confused souls and the real enemies we must fear are the radical conservative christians like me who actually pray for the unsaved. talk about scary people, huh ?"
notsarc,543,"persecution on political grounds? we are talking about a kingpin of russian organized crime here. he has been indicted in russia for fraud and political corruption (bribing politicians) and there is absolutly no question that he is guilty as sin. now he is hiding in britain and actively planning a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government...and he lays all this out to a british newspaper.  political persecution if he returns? probably not. execution for treason? that one seems more likely.  in the extradition rhetoric arena, the russians are looking a lot more reasonable then the british."
notsarc,544,"and a non-person is a non-person no matter how large it is! and i just say that it would be unjust and unfair of you to force metaphysical belief systems of your own which constitute religious belief upon your follows who may believe otherwise than you. get pregnant and treat your fetus as a full person if you wish, nobody will force you to abort it. let others follow their own beliefs differing or the same. otherwise you attempt to obtain justice by doing injustice.mo since you are not pro-choice what position are you to say what a pro-choice view is or would be? a consistent anti-choice view would be to force a rigid and unjustifiable moral code based on religious belief upon all women in a society. time after time such a concept has proven faulty. reply with quote"
notsarc,545,"please clarify what you're saying here as it makes no sense to me. what point are you trying to make ? off the top though, any comparison you make with being black and homosexuality is false because the bible doesn't condemn being black but it does condemn the homosexual act/lifestyle. and who does the anti-defamation league promote hating ? i am unaware of it if they do it."
notsarc,546,"my wife and i watch it faithfully, and there are very few shows that i make a point of watching. we've seen all of seasons 1 and 2 twice now. it really is an excellent program.  any word on season 3? i notice kevin mckidd (lucius vorenus) has his own show premiering on nbc in the fall. i'm not sure how he could film both shows at once, and rome wouldn't be the same without him. he and titus pullo make the show for me. i can't imagine what the show costs to produce per episode with all the sets, cameras, and wardrobe, but the visual presentation of the show is incredible. it brings ancient rome to life. i imagine the price tag is one of the main reasons there aren't more shows like it. waxy"
notsarc,547,mind if i ask if you drive yet? if so do you have any points on your license? 2mph seriously isn't a huge ammount and neither your speedo or the mobile cameras are usually calibrated to be that accurate.
notsarc,548,"does the enormous pay of ceos help the economy? probably not. would prohibiting enormous pay of ceos (threatening to fine or imprison people if they violated an arbitrary cap on salaries) help the economy? certainly not. is rawls argument correct, and all that remains is for us to work out the details of a totalitarian state to enforce his ideals? no."
notsarc,549,"is this a case of the truth hurting? then i guess it would work both ways. how do you feel about 'christians' slagging off non-believers, declaring that they will end up in hell for denying god? conceited? yup. could i give a toss? nope. how do you think non-believers feel about the smugness of christians? and it's not just me who thinks they're fairytales and that christians are delusional, as you well know. so why personalise it? apart from that, a lot of us here have a thick skin. this is a debating forum, and there is little room for those with delicate sensibilities who feel insulted at the pov of others."
notsarc,550,"well, signorile certainly didn't back up his opinions in this instance. how do you know it's the truth? if it were definitive, i'd be more inclined to agree. it's not 'common knowledge' that merv griffin was gay, at least not outside of hollywood. i'd never heard it myself. i don't see how you could know for certain anyone was gay that was in the closet unless they admitted to it or were seen doing something that made it clear they were (like having sex with someone of the same gender).  and the idea he should be hold some responsibility for not talking to reagan about aids in the 80s is absolutely opinion."
notsarc,551,"well, since we are talking about a gay man, i would guess it would most likely be masculine. yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? they're not going to do anything to you. if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia. gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice."
notsarc,552,"you do realize i've provided you many links that explained it was not 'red, soft tissue' that was found, right? you remember this, don't you? and yet you keep peddling the same story every couple months. why is that? http://talkorigins.org/faqs/dinosaur/flesh.html so, again, it's not 'red soft tissue' that was found. it's the permineralized remnants of what seem to be osteocytes, blood cells, and blood vessels. not exactly the 'fresh meat' you seem to like to imply it is. the samples were soaked in acid to remove the minerals. exactly how 'red' and 'soft' was this tissue. keep going, you make yourself look more the fool everytime"
notsarc,553,"don't you all understand that another great evil has left the earth? i know steeeeve, and jyoshu that you would both celebrate the death of osama bin laden. why can you not understand then that to gay people these religious right evil freaks are equlivant to bin laden, especially this evil man, who is one of the promoters of the ex gay movement."
notsarc,554,it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.
notsarc,555,"so? anyone can be a victim of sociopaths, no matter what their version of the golden rule. making one vulnerable or not, it's still a 'nicer' form of the ethic. what makes 'social cohesion' is peoples' desire for self-preservation, not compassion for others. that's not the golden rule, it's just the understanding that people are better off if they get along with others. it's sort of like the 'mutually-assured-destruction' doctrine of the cold war."
notsarc,556,"well, the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive. ram really isn't anything but a notebook, and the motherboard is more of a nervous system. so the processor and hardrive is the mind- the processor being the modivator, and the hard drive being the memory. if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon xp 3000+ in it's place, would the computer be a different computer? no. it would be the same computer."
notsarc,557,"don't you see the foolishness of that based on your own personal life experiences as a sentient human being? no. you were the one who posted that something does not need to be sentient in order to be alive. why, then, do you distinguish between two things that are obviously both alive, both of which are parasites on their hosts?"
notsarc,558,"you really are an opinionated and arrogant chump. who said that the estimated age of the universe at 14 billion y.o. is a fact? it is a figure based on man's increasing knowledge and understanding. that the figure is adjusted from time to time shows that science does not rest. on the other hand, having faith that the bible is inspired, without testing it's veracity, and then basing your life on it, it absurd in the extreme. clearly you can't differentiate between the different meanings of the word 'faith'. swallow this:"
notsarc,559,"if they are used in reference to god, then how can you possibly say they don't refer to god??? jesus himself said he he and his father are one, in john 10:30. and the three appear together numerous times in parallel grammatical construction, denoting equality. it's a harder argument to make that the three are not god and that any one is lesser than the other in terms of divinity, than to say they are god."
notsarc,560,"i just don't see that being a huge factor. it might help some, but if my goal was to improve foreign relations reigning in spending would not be the first approach i would take. can you expand on your reasoning? the start of that chain is belligerence, not out of control spending. seems to me that if you want to control spending you should work on foreign relations. that way you get into fewer wars, and when you must fight you have others helping and sharing the cost."
notsarc,561,"did prohibition of alcohol do any good? nope, just made the criminals all the more powerful. did prohibition of drugs do any good? nope, just made the criminal all the more powerful. will prohibition of legal firearms do any good? not a chance in hell. banning legal ownership has never, ever, ever done anything toward ending the illegal use of something. never has, never will. it's absolutely impossible and just shows far for withdrawn people are from the real world in their thinking."
notsarc,562,"challenge god i'll accept. all the others are open to challenge, otherwise how do you explain: john wycliff martin luther thomas moore thomas cromwell oliver cromwell george fox john wesley charles darwin helda camara need any more? all believers, all christians in fact, all challenged one or more of your list. the history of the church is one of continual attempts to move closer to god, disrupted by human failings."
notsarc,563,"how so? one thing that determines if it's on the turf of science is whether or not it's even a 'proveable' matter to begin with at all. i doubt you'll find too many christians who would say you (or they) could measurably prove god, empirically."
notsarc,564,"obama is a fresh face and very appealing......but does he have what it takes when the next big foreign policy crisis hits? obama's remarks that he would sit down without any pre-conditions to meet with the likes of iran's president and the north korean tyrant is very naive. of course now he has chaned his tune a bit and talks about 'processes' before any meeting but it illustrates his lack of experience in foreign policy. as for the economy....change is needed but what kind of changes? it needs to be the right kind of changes, change for the sake of change will not fix any problems. besides obama has not said how he will pay for these changes when there is a big deficit. obama will be ready 8 years down the road but not now."
notsarc,565,"but jyoshu isn't saying that. jy's point seems to be that the fact something cannot be disproved somehow grants or lends it some kind of validity. with such a claim being equal across all religions, the criteria for determining said validity are obviously beyond the recognised standards of reason.  are all religions equally valid? they can't all be right. it seems from jy's posts (usually in discussions with lesz,) that jy thinks the only people who oppose christianity are atheists. there are, however, many, many more people who would argue that christianity is a crock, and they should actually represent a greater 'threat' to christianity, because the foundation for their beliefs is exactly the same as jy's. jy? ** sound of crickets chirping... **"
notsarc,566,"...well...in the last decade or so we've been starving them to death. where have you been? the arguments are very similar if you consider a fetus to be a human being. i'll grant you that. in the case of your c-section question, i think the mother should have the section, but we can never compell her to do so. it would be too dangerous a precedent to contemplate."
notsarc,567,"bass, what is the response in ny?  bad news for clinton as this was one of her endorsers. and a superdelegate. will she disavow the support of the gov as she asked obama? will she reject or merely renounce? this is not a private matter. what the executive of the state does in private opens him up to bribery and blackmail and compromises his integrity. if the man can break a vow he has made before god and his wife, how can the voters trust any promise he may make? he is toast."
notsarc,568,what would make e-mail any easier? both the forum and most e-mails have spell checks. wouldn't e-mail be harder to use since referencing specific paragraphs be really difficult? sounds like trying to organize it over e-mail would be a logistical nightmare.
notsarc,569,"best interests of the nation as opposed to what? other people outside it? i reject any notion that one nation should be promoted regardless of the effects on others. faithful to what exactly? if an oath makes you do something you wouldn't otherwise do, it makes you a slave. if it doesn't make you do anything you wouldn't otherwise do, it is pointless anyway."
notsarc,570,"isly, where are those who hate all christians that are members of congregations led by those radical preachers that abhor homosexualality?  where are all those puported 'christians' who have been misled by radical preachers into hating homosexuals? the country has far more to fear from them than it does from a black preacher who dares to speak truth to power."

notsarc,573,"why do you assume the poster didn't use birth control? they said nothing about birth control; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion. also, why do you make any assumptions about suffering? according to the poster, suffering was avoided. condoms are not 100% effective. a childhood friend's younger sibling was the product of a failed condom, among other factors. nine months and nine weeks are completely different."
notsarc,574,"i am familiar with both men; and my posts sound very lockean, which if you really knew locke you would know is true. remember previously in this thread (that is, when you were travelling these parts as 'bhbcu64') where i said that there is no right to control one's body? or where i said there is no right to suicide? that is locke 101."
notsarc,575,"what does that have to do with the issue being discussed? unless you're suggesting that for gays to refer to themselves as ethmi did is an expression of self loathing. is that the point you're trying to make? beside, by presenting a film with dick gephart and gene robinson as examples of god fearing christians, you immediately expose yourself as someone who has no concept of what a true believer in christ is. so why should a film that is nothing more than secular humanist propaganda be taken seriously at all?"
notsarc,576,"so the shrub and his cabal are not in any way responsible for our economic collapse? got it! the $12b a month the shrub and his minions are sucking out of the economy to pursue boy george's mad oil war in the desert had no effect on the overall economy whatsoever. fantasy island stuff! i can just imagine what you would say if a democrat were in the white house. i suppose that you do not hold president-to-be obama responsible for reverend wright's words, correct? and yes, if i fail to secure my home from break-ins and a tragedy occurs, i am at least partially responsible. will you baruch korffs (look it up!) ever take responsibility for the mess you have created?"

notsarc,578,"so, what if 'times change' to where people no longer want to give human rights to everyone? what if 'times change' to where freedom of speech is no longer valued? that's the problem with a constitutional interpretation that doesn't include originalism; times do change, but i would hope of all things, valuing the principles of the constitution doesn't. it seems to me the more important aspect of the constitution is for it to be solid in changing times, not for it to change with them."

notsarc,582,"how did you overcome all the similiarities? nothing was ripped and i stated your question and my response. originally i could have made it clearer, but you could have also used the scroll bar. responses to specifics within a post dont carry forward. you would have to be willing to accept that proof. if your not then it isn't possible to prove it to your satisfaction is it. read the source i posted earlier. maybe we should let the church go back to allowing only priests to have bibles and if that doesn't work kill some skeptics.  i don't suppose jews, hindus, muslims and bhuddists qualify as non-believers or were you being area specific?"
notsarc,583,so? the assertion was 'evolution is based on evidence - what do you have' suggesting that one side has 'evidence' and the other none. i am simply 'balancing' it out by showing that the assertion isn't black vs white as made out.
notsarc,584,"so, have you changed your position that religion should be outlawed? actually, if there is a god and he really is god, how would that not essentially be the case? if god knowingly 'lets' someone get cancer, i don't really see how that's any different (ethically speaking) that saying he gives it to them. there's no way for a deeply religious person to view this event any other way than god having a reason for it happening."
notsarc,585,"there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan (for this election cycle anyway): dems want to repeal the tax cuts, so they have a methodology for paying for all of this. oh, and they haven't been too keen on sending men to mars either. and just a quick aside, was it legal to invade iraq? probably, b/c of the legislation broker cites. but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates 'justified' from 'legal.' the calculus used to say this was a 'just' war is a very dangerous one, and if cross-applied could justify innumerable conflicts (how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has 'dangerous activities' that make it pose an 'imminent threat'? at the very least, the entire mid-east (arab/israel) would explode under that logic)."
notsarc,586,"that seems to beg the question. be convinced one way or the other as much as you like, but if you can't prove your position, or even provide evidence for it, then how can you possibly use it to justify anything? yes, people's religious beliefs influence them. what shooter seems to be asking is if that's in any way reasonable? if you're basing your entire life on some point, should you be able to show that your beliefs about that point are true? put another way, it's kinda dumb to base major life decisions on a feeling, isn't it?"
notsarc,587,"what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. did that baby force her to conceive it? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? no, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards.  that explains everything about how irrational you are! but based on your posts though, i think they already pulled the plug. emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno  "
notsarc,588,did you know that one in ten british mothers suffer with post-natal depression? whereas: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4379422.stm it would seem that professionals are dubious about post-abortion depression. 'it showed that the women who opted for a termination reported less depression than those who chose to carry on with the unwanted pregnancy.'
notsarc,589,"do you realize, that the fetus has only recently not been defined as a human being. back when birth control first came out, planed parenthood wanted to make sure it would be leagle. so they redefined 'life' to say that you had to draw breth. by the way have you ever seen any pictures of the aborted babies? 'cause they sure like humans to me. you know most of them can already move before the abotion? look into the court hearings of judge ricard c. caey in new york. if you want to know the truth about abortion."
notsarc,590,"really? the transcript shows that he did not ask her anything in the gay marriage section of the discussion. transcript can be found here: http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/pr...al-debate.html and here: http://www.cnn.com/2008/politics/10/...ipt/index.html (click on the same-sex benefits section and the transcript shows up right next to the video) o rly?  not sure what you were watching, but it seems it wasn't the actual debate. i agree that she doesn't support gay marriage (but then biden and obama do not either), but she and biden/obama agree on civil rights for gays (visitation, contracts, etc.). just because you don't like the lady doesn't mean you should tell untruths about her (makes you look like archie)"
notsarc,591,what? i assume one is within one rights to be anti-gun. that's all.
notsarc,592,"is this in response to isly's out of context quote? he didn't even quote it correctly. it actually starts 'to avoid being mistaken for a sellout,i chose my friends carefully.' it's amazing how many people are throwing that quote, and isly's misquote, around in attempt to 'prove' that obama is a scary leftist radical. ooh, a college kid cultivating an image! what bizarre behavior, that'll come back to haunt him! :) first clinton, now obama. this is just the standard conservative smear job on the democrat-du-jour, taking out of context quotes and blowing them up to try to make someone they don't like look liberal. *shudder*"
notsarc,593,"can you support this moronic statement? the answer is obviously no. also, why should obama be less responsible for his own words on guns and religion than palin is for the words of her audience? the media will follow palin through the gates of hell and beyond to find something to demonize her. what lengths won't they take to attack republicans?"
notsarc,594,"true dat. sundowner, have you seen the life of david gale? if not, i suggest you watch it; it might change your view."
notsarc,595,were they assigned the ultimate task of interpreting the constitution and determining which laws violate it? if not then their opinion doesn't matter.
notsarc,596,will you explain and cite references on how that will happen due to their plans? another difference that obviouschild pointed out in another topic is that mccain's plan will add another 5 trillion to our national debt whereas obama's will add 3.5 trillion.  deficit increases - will mccain's or obama's tax cuts increase the national deficit more? factcheck.org: a new stitch in a bad pattern
notsarc,597,would you cite the exact article for once in your life? i'm sick of seeing the main page day after day after day.
notsarc,598,"any evidence for said 'abandonment'? also, the thing most likely to secure a lasting peace in israel-palestine is for the us to stop subsidising the oppression of the palestinian people. in any case, i thought we were talking about abm systems, i'm not aware of israel having such a system."
notsarc,599,"since when has a prescription stopped people from getting the drug? if they want it bad enough to steal it, nothing will stop them."
notsarc,600,"i keep thinking the same thing. the only conclusions i can come up with is that either the criminals are robbing people they have good reason to believe are unarmed, or that there haven't been enough deaths to violent home intruders to let them know that they're facing a serious health crisis. he didn't get shot the first time, he likely believed that she wasn't armed and wouldn't be able to resist any better than the last time; especially since he cut her power off the second time. interesting angle. i like it. we've got suicide by cop, why not suicide by victim? i sure thing he did, and i don't feel sorry for him."
notsarc,601,"ok, great so far. we're getting some good predictions on both sides. i think this is going to be a lot of fun to look back at in time. keep it up. more topics... cap and trade. will strict controls be placed? what effects if so? iraq. will he pull out? what happens then? (with iraq or terror here or whatever) how much $$$ will he throw at the economic crisis? what will the outcome be? anything you all want to predict or comment on concerning the upcoming presidency will be appreciated. have fun!"
notsarc,602,"but, as has been pointed out, your supplied definition of agnostic was incomplete. agreed. on what basis do you think that dictionary writers do come up with definitions? no - you chose part of a definition. i chose to add to it with other cited definitions and this led to our disagreement. in your opinion, i am not an atheist. but your opinion disagrees with a complete definition of the term 'atheist'."
notsarc,603,"which one is this brady? the discredited kellerman study by the discredited kellerman? or the opinion piece of the rabidly anti-gun brady campaign? cite your sources. and answer the damn question already. is self-defense with a firearm an immoral act? it's not rocket science, there's only two answers; yes or no."
notsarc,604,"okay, i think i understand a little bit more, so relative time started then right? strawman? i didn't even try to refute you; i explained what i thought you to say, noting it was different than what freedom said (though i still don't know if both of you agree on it) and asked a question about it."
notsarc,605,"so you have no idea if any states removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement?  and i'll just answer your question then which was (as you restated) [does] anybody kn[o]w of a state that had removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement. that answer is, yes, i know of a state that hard removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement.  glad i could help."
notsarc,606,"so, who's to say we're not philosophers? that's the second time i've seen you back out of a debate. i think these questions are importnat, i also think you can live a life with these questions and enjoy life to the fullest as well. in fact, i think you are missing a facet of life by not asking these questions. isn't the whole agnostic theory to ask questions, to seek the answer that is most likely not there? i think you are disillusioned.  were you raised agnostic? if not obviously you had to ask some questions to get there. anyway, mystery makes life interesting. i think life would be a waste without mystery."
notsarc,607,"i assume you take the position life begins at conception and biological potential is sufficient to claim to be a human. then why do we stop at a fertilized egg? if you mean potential, is supposed to become, or posses the correct dna to one day be then birth control would fit under birth control as would masturbation for you abortion is the immoral act of killing a human being. if we say based on results then killing is killing. the reasons are irrelevant, there is no difference between abortion, capital punishment or self defense.  yes these are extreme, but its where your position leads. at some point we make a choice and say that goes to far, but then we are back at choice and what is to much for one and not enough for another."
notsarc,608,i see alot of links to videos on this thread? but here's one that grabs my attention. i'm sure that this will shed some light on the issue.
notsarc,609,"what?!?!? you mean we just didn't take all of the oil we wanted in repayment for the money we spent defending iraq? i mean, as an imperialist superpower who allegedly imposes our will on the world, how come we didn't just take what we want or demand the deal we feel we deserve? i thought we invaded just for the oil? if so, why haven't we written the deal we wanted when it was us who set up the government which exists today?  you are so clueless as you attempt to demonize the usa, you can't even be consistent as you inadvertently admit that we have set up a fair and impartial system there which protects the iraqi's oil profits for the iraqi people themselves. but at least you're consistent in the hypocrisy and double standards which you represent. emoticonxdonno"
notsarc,610,"arafat is not a worse leader than sharon... arafat steals millions in aid money that is suppose to go to the palestinians, which 80% of them are below the poverty line. arafat advocates people to xxxx themselves up so that they may kill as many jews as possible. he is the head-figure of many of these terrorist groups and pours millions of aid into them.  sharon is worse? not only has arafat contributed to many more than 1,000 israeli casualties, his 'intifada' has continued the cycle of violence and thus caused the death of more than 2,000 palestinians."
notsarc,611,"notice how not one of your examples involves guns properly secured as i have suggested? even the gunshops had nothing more than glass between the thieves and the weapons. shameful. 'cleveland police commander wayne drummond had his city-issued 9 mm glock, fully-loaded clips, mace and police baton stolen last week when teens broke into his house in the city's southeast side when he wasn't home.' 'the glock 17 was stolen in january from lt. teresa brown, who is serving a 30-day suspension for being careless with her firearm.' 'thieves broke in through a small side window in the back of the business, in an area the gun shop owner rents to a dog groomer, the chief said.'"
notsarc,612,"how do you explain your position, on this thread, that torture is always wrong, and the americans are so f'ed up for torturing -- when you supported a military dictatorship that tortured hundreds of thousands of your fellow citizens, and in a manner that was far more brutal than what you refer to, for the u.s.? note; i've already stated my opposition to torture in any form. this is about you and your severe doublestandardistis, winston_smith."
notsarc,613,"i never said energy is going to cease to exist. if energy stops transferring, it still exists, its just not doing anything is the 'life force' energy? thats the question. from a physics perspective, can life be measured in joules? lol quantitatively, can one person have more life force than another? can you lose, gain or recharge your life force? like video game characters... is life itself physically definable? yes it exists, but can it be defined as a tangable entity or describable by physics?"
notsarc,614,"well, i agree with you. the federal government had a legitimate reason to regulate these items because it was hurting the economy, well being of people, etc i could go on. there is nothing in the constitution that says the feds can't. gay marriage and abortion are on a different level because they involve the rights of individuals as such enacting laws against them would be imho unconstitutional. also where is the proof gay marriage and abortion are degrading society? as far as i can think of there is no legitimate reason to regulate."
notsarc,615,"i am quite the anti-hypocrisy advocate. as for my personal take, 17-year olds should not be taking pictures like that. do you disagree? prejean should not have lied about it. anything beyond that is pointing out hypocrisy. seeing some of hilton's work, i don't see why he should be in a position to judge anybody. i think the 'adds a little flavor to a dull contest that no one cares about' is exactly why he was chosen."

notsarc,621,"if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation (i,e., six days, man from dust, fruit of good and evil) then what is its use? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated, or mostly inaccurate/metaphorical? genesis 1&2, in the literal application, has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without: 1. god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2. man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises. now if genesis has it wrong, then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible? from all scientific perspective, genesis 1&2 never happened, and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned."
notsarc,622,"which is pretty much normal for arch. do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries. the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts, but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation."
notsarc,623," if i was the president, god forbid; i would propose that we improve our current healthcare system little by little instead of tearing the whole thing apart and replacing it with a different one. why would it make sense to tear down a house to fix your living room? i heard this quote on fox news and agreed with it quickly if the only reason they dems want to do this is so they can get more government control, then they will spend whatever they have to spend. fool whoever they have to fool in order to carry out whatever socialist government controlled plan they can think of. the only way to stop this is to convince the majority of the country of this logical argument. people may not realize this but the only of surviving this mans presidency is to stop government control. -44j"

notsarc,628,"steeeve where are you getting this value angle from? people have a right to their lives regardless of the value of that life as determined by others. don't they? so, if a child is alive,.... no matter what stage of life, growth or development they are in,... they have a right to the life they are living. don't they? i don't get this 'value' angle. we have established that human beings have a right to their lives. a prebirth child is a human being so, a prebirth child should have a right to their life.  the life that they are already living. simple as that."
notsarc,629,"do you mean when pelosi said the protestors had nazi banners, when they were actually banners saying 'no' to nazism? she's in the democrats. you mean the fantasy land whitehouse version of the proposals, that no one has actually read? no one that understands the constitution would say that, that's a very ignorant comment. what's perverted is that you think freedom of speech means the people have to shut up while they listen patiently to the government propaganda machine."
notsarc,630,"that's pretty much assumed that god is magic. hence why we laugh at it when it is presented as a viable alternative to testable fact.  what is more interesting is that archie who believed unless i'm mistaken that his god is perfect, is in fact a huge liar.  btw, did you read the link i posted? it took 20 pages before a creationist took a stab at the arguments. archie didn't even try."

I am actually asking a legitimate question and have yet to have it answered. WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE? The second ammendment sheds no light on this.

As for you understanding the concept of gravity effecting the speed of light, can you explain why it has this effect?

sarc,697,you kind of made a good point here... both the government and the church have ulterrior motives for 'helping the poor': the politicians hope to gain votes and the church hopes to gain converts...both groups of suckers will be paying back for the rest of their lives in one way or another.  and the church collects more of 'it's own money' to purchase more poor sinners. both groups are indentured servants to their masters. what do you mean 'generous with your own money'? isn't that what the government is? perhaps the christians don't want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their souls to it. both are doing a terrible job of 'helping the poor'.

sarc,738,"like in afghanistan? hopefully it will go a little better with this puppet, his own bodyguard was the latest in a slew of assasination attempts."
sarc,739,"so atop a mountain of ignorance is where we will find religious people? yeah, sounds about right to me."
sarc,740,"spoken like someone truly out of touch with reality. how long has it been since you were in high school? because if it hadn't been so long you'd know that short of coming to school in a banana suit (maybe not even then), kids could give two sh*ts about what other kids are wearing."
sarc,741,"so the creationists among us seem to be saying that there is no proof for evolution, am i right? well, other than the facts of fossils, dna similarities, carbon dating of remains etc. maybe you have a point. but it seems to me that there is quite a bit less proof for the existence of god... hmm a book written by people 2000 years ago? well thats definitely fact, rather than a work of 'fiction'. and how long ago was the world really 'created', 20 million years or there abouts. what was happening in those years between then and the time of jesus? maybe god was asleep. if he does sleep... hmmmm or maybe, he doesnt exist.... but then again that just couldnt be true could it... emoticonxconfused"
sarc,742,"if reality conflicts with the bible, there are people that tend to 'reinterpret' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality. this is inexcusable in my opinion. to me, the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality. what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese, and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence, rather than admit you lied, you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said."
sarc,743,you know who else is not normal? one who has an i.q. of 122 or higher.
sarc,744,"but wouldnt it mean that if she (if phunting is female) burns in hell, that would mean that god really exists. do you believe in god? also, do you think that if god really does exists that he's just bluffing about that hell stuff? hmmmm..."
sarc,745,the liberal propoganda army is on the way? the man  must be lonesome!
sarc,746,she didn't have answers to about 12 questions...'i don't know. ' 'i wasn't informed of that'...talk about uninformed political hacks? we have 'leadership' emoticonxrolleyes that defines 'uninformed'.
sarc,747,god has emotions wow. that has got to be ridicules thing i heard in the old days you talked like that they would send you to a cuckoo farm. god loves you god hate s you etc etc etc. what a bunch of hog wash. what do people mean by that? you would think god sat down and had breakfast with you or something like that. emoticonxwow
sarc,748,"i'm having trouble following your line of thinking. could you please post in a common language, preferably english? i don't think anyone wants to ridicule you but if your posts are indecipherable you make discussion impossible."
sarc,749,"knowing more than just a little about my fte compadres, and those that i know personally, they would fight along beside me and i them to preserve our freedoms. to go as far to bow down? when they have taken what smidgen of life is left in me. but in direct answer to your post, jim: they are doing so as we speak."
sarc,750,"so, terral03, you just supposed i am an athiest? in fact i'm a white witch, if you must know. these are better than black witches (because they are white, and therefore superior). we have come to this realm to feed on the flesh of the innocent (and to point out contradiction in the bible.)  emoticonxclown"
sarc,751,"yeah, silly me for thinking that the english language came from england. gosh that's obviously because i didn't get all those 'a's at school. i am, it is. where is 'here'? we are online, there is no 'here'. and the 'modern english language'? i speak the modern english language, you speak the us version of the modern english language. personally i feel that the sign of true high iq is using your supposed score to boast about it on internet forums and ask for other peoples scores to 'make another mockey (sic) of' them."
sarc,752,you'd be hard-pressed to get me to agree with your definition of 'conservative' . and i'd love to tell them. do you have their e-mail addresses? i'll start with chickenshit kennedy.
sarc,753,"yeah your the other bright guy who keeps spouting off opinions but never states facts. the media constantly puts out reports against bush, not to mention any republican. do you remember the biggest joke in political history grey davis?? the media thought he was a god, even after we booted him the hell out. start giveing facts, i could really care less about your uneducated opinion"
sarc,754,"it must because he's a liberal. hey sarah, how come bushie's daddy, cheney, and rumsfeld all used to rub elbows with saddam? must be cause they were led astray by some liberal..."
sarc,755,of course you can pass that sort of opinion off and some people actuall believe it. how on earth it can be tested? i guess we're only going to respect the sweeping generalisation a typical atheist trick!
sarc,756,"that's certainly an issue in its own right, yes - but matthew's gaffe is suggestive of the kind of post-hoc jiggery-pokery that shaped the bible's contents. as far as fulfilling prophecy goes, is it really prophecy if someone knowingly sets out to make it come true? zechariah could have had the messiah turning up walking backwards eating a pork pie - so long as any would-be messiah knows what he has to do :) and when all's said and done, the new testament was written decades after the fact, with the old testament near at hand, a desire to spread christianity burning in the breast, and nobody to say these prophecies hadn't been fulfilled. i respect your decision to believe they were, but i don't see any objective reason to agree."
sarc,757,"a book is harassing you? emoticonxwow i'd get a court order taken out on it. but yes, of course it is subjective, however just because it is illegal to harass someone (or incitement of racial/religious hatred, which is also illegal) i would hardly say that consitutes the doom of freedom of speech. as a supreme court justice once said, 'freedom of speech does not include the right to shout fire!' in a crowded theater.'"
sarc,758,"so now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?  i expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? am i to believe that you are a soldier there now?  your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. i posted exactly what i meant to and you went off on a tangent. i asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if 'show me yours before i show mine?' pitiful."
sarc,759,"hmm..the root of the word global is 'globe' and the word 'globe' refers mainly to the earth, the world, the planet as a whole. how much more general can you get? i'd have to agree that this could quite possibly be the worst comment in the history of comments. maybe next time, kiddo."
sarc,760,"================================================== ====== ================================================== ====== ================================================== ====== ================================================== ====== so a river with a sandy bottom is not a river? so a human on steroids is not a human? so a sword tempered by heat is not a sword? i'm not following your definition, because you contradict yourself earlier. but then: is faith used in conjunction with reason somehow not faith used with reason? i realize you have to be illogical/irrational to argue your side, but i don't appreciate it. so, i was correct to reply: faith, belief without evidence, arrived at through reason, which by definition requires evidence.  inconsistent. so, go figure, i was correct all along and you just didn't know it. -mach"
sarc,761,"so, clive, everyone that believes that god created the earth is an idiot? you need to spend some quality time with some that do and i think you'd change your tune."
sarc,762,"what do you not understand about a republican 527 running a communist for kerry campagin? right....well, we know that iran expliciately endores bush....and lilkely the kkk as well. so... ball is in your court."
sarc,763,"shall we regress to babble?  the government is already heavily into the term 'marriage'. not only the us government, but governments all over the world refer to 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and a woman. changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere.  what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa? do we need to define several types or classes of 'married couple'. what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one's spouse instituted a death penalty for it? i would argue that legally joined same-sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples, but not for redefining 'marriage' solely for the purpose of calling them such."
sarc,764,"are you talking about the love of god or the love of the politically-correct? as the bible says, 'love does not rejoice in iniquity,' and, 'love does a neighbor no harm' (like enticing one's neighbor into a sinful, carnal relationship). trying to bring people to god's way of loving is a most unappreciated endeavor. so pedophilia and wife beating are okay with you? neither of those are in the ten commandments either. do you really think god approves of those?  but god is on record about gay sex. you might want to read leviticus 18:22, leviticus 20:13, romans 1:26-27 and jude 7 to become acquainted with god's admonitions against gay sex."
sarc,765,"lol lol lol you have denied repeatedly that it is a religious issue, and now you say it is a 'sin'. can't you make up your mind about anything? is gambling a sin? is drinking alchol a sin? is charging interest on a loan a sin? you seem to be very arbitrary in where you draw your lines regarding a lot of things. regardless, it simply is not a religious issue."
sarc,766,"yes. your point? have you? as poor a typist as i am, and as full of mis-spellings as most of my posts are that is the best you can do? i must be slipping."
sarc,767,"this particular one, formulated the way it is, might well fail. that's why i hope the stupid attorney stops where he is.  where do you get this bizarre idea that the court shies away from 'controversial' issues? ooooo... that's a persuasive legal argument. i'm impressed (not). gay people have been 'earning it' for over 100 years. in the short-term, we may suffer setbacks, in the long-term, there's no stopping us. another unsubstantiated pov that also happens to be untrue. no matter how many times the ditto-heads on the right say it, it remains a fact that the state supreme courts that have recognized the right of same-sex to marry have been dominated by moderate and conservative, republican-appointed judges. of course, they're part of the fading breed of conservatives... the ones who believe in individual rights and freedom."
sarc,768,"why do you describe them as 'obstructionist' scripts? if someone can't admit to making bad decisions 2 years ago, or at least admit they'd do things differently with what we know today, why should we assume they wouldn't make the same mistakes again?? in the real world, we use job interviews to probe for competence and ability, i guess you're just for hiring anyone that agrees with the boss."
sarc,769,and that makes it so? i've got this nice little 4-lane bridge over the trinity river that i can let you have cheap. dono
sarc,770,"gevorkian azat lol, do u think america wants their oil, yeah? omg, dont u be so naive, buddy. wanna know why america wants azerbajan? we want it for the future war against iran. didnt u know it? lol azerbajan is a very good place for our military bases. air bases and everything else of the kind. do u know how it is convenient when u only have to fly some 500 km drop yo bombs upon tegeran and be back. u will even have some time left to write a letter home and have a nap after lunch, huh. again, we will have a chance to have several hundreds soldiers from north azerbajan absolutely for free. after war in iran azerbajan will have iranian northn provinces and will retract their claims for karabakh. armenians relax and enjoy it. wheeeee"
sarc,771,"dont come tell me who is a die hard christian. that is sick, did god place you in a place of christian authority? no, it just so happens, god did not. it would have been far more acceptable for you to come and ask me or some other die hard, proven christian. proven? yes, snatched out of addictions and my former life style for the sole purpose of exalting christ name. i was smart already, was talented already, and was already the best at what i did. but christ showed me a whole new light. immediately, in one moment of time, i didn't even want to smoke weed or any of the things i had just a second ago been doing. born agian. that was september 2001, haven't touched any of it. if you want to know, next time ask."
sarc,772,"your a wall. and where did i do this? ok, perfesser, even if i did do more research my stance would not change.  i never asked you to. like the old saying goes it takes a xxxxx to know a xxxxx. :)"
sarc,773,"then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? silly, i 'd say! humans are part of the animal kingdom. mammals if i remember from biology. are you not an animal? if not, maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon."
sarc,774,"you're right justine. organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others. why use your brain and heart if you don't have to? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way, they think it's 'morally' alright. 'sickening' is a good way to put it."
sarc,775,"parents want convenience and to pacify their children with a 'happy meal'. most kids don't ask for lettuce, they ask for burgers. wonder why mcdonalds doesn't add a soy burger to their menu? they have salads and adding soy products would be another way to show they 'care' about health. the answer might be they have done consumer research and found the costs to create/market a new soy product outweight the profits."
sarc,776,"right from your copy-n-paste arsenals, huh? wow some of those sites you all are posting are scary. most of them are activist-oriented sites, special interest groups etc.  not exactly an unbiased bunch. 'exgaywatch?' omg."
sarc,777,but should the elected legislature based in part on partisan politics be telling our courts which case to look at and which case not to look at? i thought there was a reason we had 3 seperate branches of government.
sarc,778,"the important question is; do i care? hitler was elected. the fact people participate in a ritual ceremony to consecrate the government of the day every 3 or 4 years makes it no more or less valid in my eyes. explain why china would have any motivation to nuke europe. until you can do that, all this 'china's gonna get you unless you support us global hegemony!!' is tired old scare tactics, typical fascist fearmongering from those seeking any justification for us wrongs they can find. china is wrong in its actions against tibet. that doesn't mean we should support wrongful behaviour by the us."
sarc,779,"that's probably being saved for the next round of national election fodder. maybe something on the order of occupying all the me, making it a christian democracy while we use their oil for their own good? with every family owning their own home, two cars and a boat. wait, they've used that promise and it failed. not to worry, i'm sure they'll come up with something that'll keep the sheep headed towards the cliff."
sarc,780,"no doubt referencing fox, huh? silly me, i should watch the real experts...cnn, cbs, nbc, abc...oh yeah, folks i would trust to give me complete, unbiased reporting. anyway, you choose to follow whatever the scumbag husband says, and i choose to follow the prudent path. by the way, she was already in this 'vegetative state'...how could he have suddenly decided it's not what she wanted...coincidentally around the time he shacked up with the other chick...gullible to say the least"
sarc,781,"yeah, you are right dono.....so explain to me about the constitution??? would you like to start with the federalist papers and move on from there? i have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution. if you think that the cruel and unusual term doesn't apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken. how do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now? the court 15yrs ago said differently!!! how can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion? this is scary..people, you gotta think this stuff through!"
sarc,782,"if homosexuals don't think, how can they choose to become good vaginal penetrators? the fact is, the more homosexuality there is, the less abortions. if you were a gay you could rest assured that your man-wife would never abort once. are you willing to sacrifice the lives of billions of innocent children to your personal feelings like lust towards vaginas?"
sarc,783,"they must suffer terribly in the deep snows of the canadian winter, eh? no wonder they're pouring south over the border. little emoticonxcensored ers."
sarc,784,"hey, heres a wacky idea..... how about some evidence to support creationism, ray? its all well and good finding fault with the paradigm, but the 'failure' of evolution to explain whatever it is you are rambling about, does in no way build a case for your belief.  so lets be seeing it. evidence for a 6000 year old earth, made by god."
sarc,785,"whoa! duo. give the kid a chance. it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical 'proof' that his god exists. certainly, since he is a 'philosophy and theology' major he must understand the implications of 'proof' in the context of science, as well as the meaning of the term 'empirical'. after all, wouldn't those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand? so let's await his 'empirical proof' without laughter. wait until he presents his 'empirical proof' before we laugh."
sarc,786,"you know, bob caught the point i was making. why was it so hard for you to see it?  so many anti's whine and complain and compare, but as soon as the tables are turned, it's all 'mr. innocent' and 'i don't see the comparision.'  i see, it's ok for you to be biggoted and hateful, but not for anyone else. yup, the typical 'do as i say, not as i do' attitude. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,787,"but do you ever question it for your self? or are you content to just show up .. and let someone else tell you what it all means. the rcc has made , by their own admission, mistakes in the past are you suggesting that it won't happen again? are you suggesting they never made a mistake in their interpitation of the bible? if so you might want to tell that to gallileo remember him ? he was burned at the stake for telling the rcc that the earth went around the sun!"
sarc,788,"oh, so now you're claiming to be a psychologist too?! wow, you sure get aroud a lot!  hmmm...a failed shrink arguing over homosexuality with actual homosexuals. what does that suggest?  tomshairybills; you are way over your head and i really hate to be the one who has to keep telling you this, but you're not doing yourself any favors by continuing to dig that hole you're in even deeper."
sarc,789,yes i see you calling him names. shooter..who brought pol pot back from the dead? i feel like i'm thumbing through a jihadist website for ecoterrorists.  this is a legitimate argument? sad but funny at the same time:) i never said i tried ignoring you..you constantly fail to read my posts
sarc,790,"what about god? so many god-fearing people, he must be a terrorist :) seriously i really don't know much about terrorists. i know that bin laden was behind 9/11 but he wasn't the only one, but that's about it."
sarc,791,"so, you admit defeat to a child? you have no argument and can only name call. answer my posts with something other than ad hominem or admit defeat."
sarc,792,"you didn't even read the articles i posted did you? how does it feel to be a fraud, specifically a user of argument via laziness.  you are no better then the great deciever, satan. :p"
sarc,793,"they don't have toilets there. they have buckets to poop in. the guards threw the korans in the buckets. but yeah, who needs credible reporting? bush reported that saddam bought uranium from niger. this was based on a forged report from a source that the cia said wasn't credible. that sparked some violence and deaths if i recall."
sarc,794,wrong again!! .. as was just politely pointed out to me a minuet ago it's about ' what does termination stop ' and my answer adresses this. it's a valid point .. focus on the life here first befor allowing more unwanted life to be come a part of the system.  have you adopted an unwanted child yet? if not i would submit you should focus you anti abortion energy on those kids first.
sarc,795,"and suddenly vor's list of incorrect statements has finished another lap around the universe! the area which was litterally saturated with cruise missiles was sparsely populated. the brass complained about 'hitting empty tents with multi-million dollar cruise missiles.'  suddenly you are concerned with killing innocent civilians? seriously, you have no problem when bush's policies gets a few thousand killed, but the instant clinton's massive cruise missile launch aganist terrorists kills one innocent, you're all over him. talk about massive hypocracy. you bitch about clinton not doing anything, then you bitch when his attacks on terrorism cause collateral.  seriously, get some therapy and some education."
sarc,796,there is no link that i know of..............do you know what cspan is? its a television network here in the u.s...........it shows demonstrations and protests among other things............. what other flags are you talking about? emoticonxconfused i don't know about where you live but in this country we have only one national flag....... maybe where you live you want to protect toilet paper.if you do go for it.......... emoticonxrolleyes you have a lot to learn in life young man.....hopefully with age will come wisdom.........
sarc,797,"what kind of question is that? we can't have true freedom until dissenters have been hunted down and killed, or tossed into th gulag...er, i mean, prison, for demonstrating their dissent."
sarc,798,"a majority of the planet believes in a higher power, so i allready have the majority agreement on this. how about you come up with a test to see if god doesnt exist... well? i'm waiting."
sarc,799,"holy cow! so you are an aussie now? in various other forums you have claimed to be chilean, german, and god knows what else....whatever suited you at that moment. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,800,"depends. how big is the bear? if it was a gorilla, and he was 400 lbs, then he can xxxx anywhere he xxxxxxn pleases. i ain't messing with that.  :p"
sarc,801,so then women who are pregnant shouldn't be allowed to 1) smoke 2) take any kind of drug that could possibly harm the child 3) drink or do any otherwise legal action? and vor takes another giant step towards fascism.
sarc,802,"generalisations - do not europeans make huge generalisations about americans too ? is it the usual double standard ? europeans can make generalisations, but americans cannot make generalisations."
sarc,803,hey hydra - -  you know what i find amazing? all the men on this board who found pregnancy to only be a minro inconvenience. i am am just anxious for them to tell me more about their pregnancies....
sarc,804,"let's say that the law, based upon some kind of verifiable scientific data, decides that some folks are inferior to other folks, and thus less of a person? you know, if the law said 'because you are black, you are less of a person than shomeone who is white. you shouldn't be upset though, all scientific data suggests that you, because you are black, are truly inferior to those who are white.' would you think, because the law said so, that a black person was in fact a non-person?"
sarc,805,"how did cjd come about again? i know it had somethig to do with cows and chickens, but i forget the details."
sarc,806,"every single time you make the assisinine statement 'the baby isn't the woman's body' you downplay the part the woman's body plays. maybe it isn't the body - but it can't live without the woman's body. the owner of said body should be making decisions for said body.  when you are willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who is pregnant - you are hi-jacking her body. i forget - are you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifers? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it.  i still don't give a damn what they may or may have not have thought about abortion, nor was that an argument i was trying to make."
sarc,807,"you ever seen 'schindler's list?' how about ever read a book about the holocaust? i'm guessing not, because you have no clue what you're talking about. there is a huge difference between using psychological 'torture' if you wanna call it that for the purposes of extracting information and what the nazis did. not providing a detainee air conditioning is as bad as the nazis? playing rap music too loud? hell, even chaining someone in a room for long periods of time...sure, it's unpleasant, perhaps to a great degree. but come on, i'd rather go through all of that than endure a nazi pow or concentration camp."
sarc,808,"don't you insult african americans!  i have posted a number of times links and comments by prominant black leaders who infact do support gay marriage. when will you stop your 'don't insult african americans' lies when you know all too well just how wrong you actually are?  oh that's right...never, because you just don't care what anyone thinks if it at all differs from your opinion.  weren't you spanked enough in the 'banned people' forum?"
sarc,809,"you are attempting to trivialize the bias we who are gay, face, against our sexuality. you try to trivialize everything we have accomplished in terms of social acceptance, that heterosexuals have always taken for granted. your assinine comments show sensitivity to no one. maybe you'd like to start a pride movement for ignorant, insensitive, jackasses? society is moving so against that group right now."
sarc,810,"not to me, but let's not quibble about things we can't change. let's talk about something that we can change...for a change. we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that's written. how about making a proposal suited to fit those whose religious beliefs tend to make us feel inferior? or passing legislation that more medical staff be trained in 'special' fields of medicine for certain diseases so that constant referrals won't bounce us off the walls."
sarc,811,really?! cool!  can you tell me where to find one these places that will turn me into a lesbian? men have been such a pain in my xxx all these years. i am sick and tired of finding them attractive. emoticonxrolleyes
sarc,812,and you don't think 9/11/01 was and attack on this country huh? emoticonxrolleyes  you are exactly the kind of liberal carl rove was talking about in his speech the other day.......
sarc,813,"degress of being christian? so i can say i am only half christian? a level 2 christian? is it like medicare i am christian part a, but will become part b at age 65....."
sarc,814,"then what are you doing in this thread? or to quote yourself: game, set, match, gamehuis is teh win!11@!@11 :p"
sarc,815,"but they do come under the definition. why do you say they don't? what evidence do you have to say they don't? the fetus/embryo is part of the human species. you define species as a group of organisms that are capable of reproduction among themselves. this just to to define species and not the individual organism. as i said, a 1 day old baby can't reproduce, many 90yr old man can't either. some are born without the abilty and never will reproduce. however, the general population can reproduce and thus they are all in the same species. the embryo has all it needs to grow. food and other enviromental stuff is not part of oneself is it? what you are saying is that you are not a human because you require food and other enviromental needs to grow."
sarc,816,no practical purpose?! i'dcall preventing the killing of fetuses practical. so would most rational people. emoticonxrolleyes
sarc,817,"[quote=justinecredible]making a snap judgement like that doesn't win you any brownie points either. genesis 18 - 19  deuteronomy 23:17  how about a more specific condemnation from the bible, then? will that help? leviticus 18:22 'you [masculine] shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.'   leviticus 20:13 'if a man lies with a male as a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.'   any ambiguity there, jc? emoticonxrolleyes  oh no, jc's going to start quoting scripture at me. better find a good search engine if you want to go there. :)"
sarc,818,"'poor bill' ? yes poor poor bill, i really feel sorry for him for having the misfortune to meet monica . anybody who had the bad luck to meet monica deserves our compassion and pity. yes.... poor poor bill....so hillary was a saint and lord knows what monica was !"
sarc,819,"well, we're not talking about the right to privacy now, are we emoticonxrolleyes  oh no! of course not ... if don't want to include the issues of lost homes, lack of hospital visitation, lack of health insurance coverage, no access to survivor benefits, unfair taxation, etc.. no harm at all emoticonxrolleyes  but they're not adults now, are they? love the red herring, btw. discrimination has to be justified. otherwise it is unconstitutional. not true. their marriages may not be recognized. doesn't make them illegal though. for one thing, the whole 'slippery-slope' argument is a logical fallacy. and secondly, since we do not live in a true democracy (this is a constitutional republic, after all), the rights of the minority cannot be infringed upon by the majority. milk and cookies for you for voting, though :)"
sarc,820,"why shouldn't iran have them? perhaps because they signed a treaty saying they wouldnt in the precious un, of course i think we are all in agreement that the un is more or less a waste of time and money. how about the whole death to america slogan? now we have one of the grass roots nutters from teh revolution as the iranian president. it could be there un-ending support for hezbollah and hamas, neither having any qualms about its hatred for the us. like i said, there are some that just don't get it. count yourselves among that crowd."
sarc,821,"what joe was saying is: what is 's?'  not to mention the really terrible lack of usage of capitol leters. try just a little basic grammar, huh?  also, to 'love' your brother is to support you brother. not to mention the fact that more than half of all heterosexual marriages end in divorce, so why complain about homosexuals and what you claim as 'pretending?'  i mean, what skin is it off your nose anyway?  what's sad is you point your finger at those you don't understand and who you think are different from you, when all along, you're no better."
sarc,822,how about when it dawns on you who he was when he came the first time? lol! trade in your blinders for some spiritual light!
sarc,823,"no, it's pertinent to the behavior of some homoseuxals. not all.  no, it's not the article we have a problem with, it's the person who posted it. you!  oh, that's right, you are free to criticize the gay rights movement all you want, but when anyone dares to criticize you and your motives it's a whole new ball game?  actually it is. why did you ignore my post? i responded with other 'sexual health' related articles, but i see you ignored them...they are reality as well.  honey, your religious beliefs wouldn't be of issue if they did not directly oppose our movement to gain equal access to rights. duh!"

sarc,827,"only two choices? poor god, infinity reduced to black or white."
sarc,828,poet i found it interesting your illutration of the 'matirx' series. i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones. i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging. all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power. much like mankind is decived by satan today. a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery. even those who have seen the truth and reject it. this sounds alot like the account of the bible. i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues. will neo's death be that which saves all mankind? we will wait and see.
sarc,829,"kronus, like i said, you have to accept that (abiogenesis) by faith, don't you, since no one has ever seen it take place? and it can't be replicated either, can it?  oh ye of great faith! lol!"
sarc,830,"1. who said i didnt? 2. no. do i need to? 3. why would i need to preach to people? to annoy and inflame? 4. thats dennis quaid you dolt. from the film 'the right stuff' you should see it, but bewarned it contains some decidedly unchristian messages such as desecration of the sacred sound barrier, references to air 'demons', the use of rocketry, use of the heliocentric model of the solar system, 'pagan' aboriginies and presbeterians. you'll love it."
sarc,831,"orion's follies: some other goodies from that site... never linked to those specific articles.  but before orion gets too self-righteous, let's look at some ot the topics he considered 'funny' in a link he gave over at the usat creation / evolution forum: christian crimes - pastor molests widow's boys - pastor molests adopted daughters - priest molests altar boys - late for church - christian racist kidnapper - music pastor molests - bush's faith-based failure - pastor molest, guns, drugs - $400,000 missing - priest molests - church youth coach molests - bush suppresses student prayer - sen byrd's 'white ('n' word)'  is this funny? it's apparently real funny to orion. his link also had a pornographic sub-link on the virgin mary, describing her in graphic, profane language.  orion - christ-deniers like you and brummer need a lot of help."
sarc,832,ok. so are you going to follow all the other laws about stoning people to death too? hmmmmmmmmmm. emoticonxfrazzled  guess i better go find a bunch  of rocks. next question being:'who do i throw at first?' what about 'glass houses?'
sarc,833,"bush can't run again, so who's the idiot? emoticonxrolleyes  won't happen. i'm not stupid enough to buy a house below sea level in a known flood plain. ut don't let me influence your decisions. ;)  and you dnc parots have no originality.  hum, i'm not sure i know what a gop christian is. is that like a catholic with a twist? emoticonxclown"
sarc,834,"well, who was the head of fema appointed by? a brief googling seems to suggest a mr. g.w. bush was responsible, it wouldn't be entirely out of the question for dubya to appoint another member of the christian right to this permission, who might be keen for christian charities to be promoted. other possible reasons are that religion is very strong in the south, and hence religious charities are more likely to have resources in the south, were the problem is. in any case, the red cross is by far the largest organisation involved, and as has already been estalbished is secular. and as i said before just because the organisations are christian doesn't necessarily mean that their workers or contributors are."
sarc,835,"saying you have an 'anti-supernatural bias' is akin to saying you have a bias for common sense, logic and reason. why don't you believe my cup of coffee is god? because you have no proof? well, that's an easy argument to over-come; it's supernatural, so it doesn't need to obey your mundane laws. -wez"
sarc,836,a bit over the top here eh? quicksand?...butcher babies? wow...very sensational... i have a question for ya ez? do you own any slaves? do you have a beard or long hair? have you stoned any non-virgin brides lately. seeing as though you are so adherant to the bible....i figure you at best have smited a neighbor or two this week?

sarc,838,"i wonder how there could be such accurate data before satellites? how did people track storms deep in the atlantic i wonder. maybe they could have followed them with ships, but that would be very dangerous, and how would they know when the storm started?"

sarc,841,"trebor - it's humerous to watch your denial mechanism work overtime, trebor. for the 3rd of 4th time, where in your tanakh does it say your animal sacrifices for sin were abolished? shouldn't you be out trying to find a nice young lamb or ram for slaughter? lol!"
sarc,842,"i can't believe he used that on me. just goes to show that he will mimic not only preachers but any one else that he thinks will make him look good at the time. ez why don't you stop this?? people will actually converse with and discuss things that you feel are important if you would only think for yourself. forget the dogma,.. forget the spoon feed interpetations of a dusty old book and think for yourself. people will actually begin to take you seriously."
sarc,843,"why say these two things together? is there a bestiality issue bubbling under the surface here? you appear to have esteem issues here as well as a persecution complex. we're not all abusing and attacking and berating you, or your precious little birds either. @liminus- by the way, i though 'volcanoes of prejudice' was one of the coolest phrases i've heard in a while."
sarc,844,"see, it's fun. finally, some one came to this thread and posted something. i had in mind the song 'hard on me' by asia but oh well. someone finally posted on here besides me and the 'more reference' question from master_shake. now, can someone take my post here and do the exact same thing? i'll use a lot of words so you have stuff to take out and mess with and play around with all you want. so now there is only one question that i have...who's next?"
sarc,845,"my hate of iniquity vs. your love for it? get a new dog, brummer."
sarc,846,"what are you? nuts? you know that in our 'gun free' society, you are more likely to be a victim of violent crime, armed robbery or homicide than you were before the howard government tightened the gun laws? i mean, you know we are less safe now, right? but hey, at least we can rest easy knowing people are only be being bashed and stabbed to death, rather than shot. god bless australia, huh?"
sarc,847,"no reply bassman? seriously mate, i can understand why some people on this forum have a problem with you, you can't just go around posting total lies! you are a sensible guy, for the most part, lets have some reasonable arguments as oppose to mindless bigotry."
sarc,848,"i don't know, terran. are you scared poohbear? do you actually have any evidence to bring to us? we'd love to see some! really we would! if you could show us some hardcore, physical evidence that proves god did it, it would be the scientific revelation of the century! oh what's that? you don't have any? not even a poorly crafted straw-man argument? damn, and here i was thinking you were capable. oh yes, and if you could give us some firm, solid evidence that darwin is burning in hell, we would all drop our copies of origin and bow down the lord.  whats that? you don't have any...?"
sarc,849,depends on what you mean by 'history'.  did george washington really cut down the cherry tree? that is fiction. did george washington exist? that is documented.. and is history.
sarc,850,"also, there was a bit of a fuss over warhammer some time ago (during the ad&d is evil times) while it makes it perfectly clear that magic comes from daemons and dark gods. don't see why aliens are exempt too, the bible makes it pretty clear that these arn't real either - surely then they must be daemonic tempters as well (damn xenos)? lets not even go a step further and combined psychics and the force, yet there seemed little outcry over star wars (well phantom menace maybe..but different people, different reasons). whole thing seems bizarre to me, surely for these to be evil its admitting that witchs and wizards actual existed and still do?"
sarc,851,"what country are you from? in america the people have never had the ability to decided law. the legislature writes it, the executive approves it, and the judiciary interprets it. the people have no direct say what so ever."

sarc,854,"i like how you automatically assume anyone who disagrees with you is an atheist. of course, if they were true believers(tm), then they wouldn't disagree with you, right? yeesh... i really like the sly implication that all of us who try and educate ourselves must be unemployed. surely no one would hire us atheistic evilutionists, right? glad i could make you feel important the odd spelling mistake is understandable, but you'd think when someone's trying to tear down the most solid scientific theory around they would at least know how to spell 'scientist'. it's not like it's hard. you even went to dictionary.com to get a definition, and still managed to spell it wrong!"
sarc,855,"then you are wrong, in a general way! :-) virions (free viruses) are composed of organic molecules: proteins (in their capsids) and nucleic acids (in their cores), and some also have lipids (in their envelopes). what did you think viruses were made of?  excuse me, but i didn't create a false generalization."
sarc,856,"that's not what the bible says. you're playing word games. what next? numerology??? i mean, i can play around with interpreting too. i can take 'roses are red, violets are blue' and interpret it to mean just about whatever i want it to. let's see, roses represent love, and red is the color of blood. a key characteristic of violets is that they have small flowers, and blue means sad. so what 'roses are red, violets are blue' is really and truly saying - and you must all bow down and accept my absolute insight into this - is that 'love is bloody awful, and people with 'small things' are sad'. bet you never knew that's what it was really saying!"
sarc,857,"as i observed earlier, you seem intent on attacking islam. why else would you devote so much energy to a thread entitled 'muhammed's child bride'? you've said it yourself, as in... and... howard suggested to you that you might learn something about islam by reading rumi. you asked me to quote to you from rumi? very well... spring is christ, raising martyred plants from their shrouds. their mouths open in gratitude, wanting to be kissed. the glow of the rose and the tulip means a lamp is inside. the wind is the holy spirit. the trees are mary. the scent of joseph's shirt comes to jacob. a red carnelian of yemeni laughter is heard by muhammad in mecca. and... moses, the inner light of revelation, lit up the top of sinai, but the mountain could not hold that light."
sarc,858,why do you want to cram it down other people's throats? do you really think it will earn you brownie poins in heaven? can't you followthe word of god without demanding the rest of us do? talk about perversion....get out of my decision to be faithful or not - creep.

sarc,860,"1) is that supposed to counter me? where's your logic that explains why god would create jesus before the printing press? without the printing press, books were copied by hand, leading to lots of errors and discrepencies in the vast number of copies.  2) are there only two types of people in the world: 'easyriders' and 'michael moores'? god is just pretend!"

sarc,863,can you actually back up your claims? if the bill does not affect criminals then why has gun crime been going down since the brady law became a law? a simple question. how did they break the law? the background check would stop them from breaking the law by not allowing them to purchase a gun. if you don't support background checks then you support criminals just walking into a store and buying a gun and then going free after they have illegally purchased a gun. why do you want criminals to go free after they've broken a law?  are you for real? i've never heard of a hate group that hates inanimate objects.
sarc,864,"boy $346,000? i can think of a few $300,000 firearms in existance today. if anyone of them every shot and killed a person, boy it would be sooooo easy to trace it down. so then why bother banning them? using a $300,000 gun to shoot someone is like hit and run in a bright red ferrari in a busy intersection, the cops are going to find you."

sarc,866,"who decides which portions are appropriate for literal interpetation? how od you know they are right? has it ever occured to you that the whole invisible man in the sky thing is probably not a good canidate for literal interpetation?  perhaps, as the roman elite at the time claimed, the bible was compiled, and christianity was heavily pushed, primarily as a method of controlling the people. we know the bible was heavily edited. we know that much of it was written decades after the events occured, and not by the folks claimed. isn't literally interpeting anything that fraudulent a pretty poor idea?"

sarc,869,"uhm, dude, you asked me to explain! you asked for it: you got it: now you whine!?!?!?! and you can avoid asking me questions, especially if you don't think you are going to like th answer. you sure can. just don't ask for my opinion again, or i will give it to you again!"
sarc,870,"but to some it is the word of their god. you see? you have no god so you dont have to worry (at least not yet). and 'divine', so you are saying besides sarcastic rhetoric that they were divinely inspired cause you labled them that. sears is now jcpenney's get with the times. and no it wouldnt be hung there cause you can tbuy drapes in revelation. fiction: archaeologival evidence is fiction? sick: yes soddom and ghamorah was a sad story. dangerous: yes to those who feel their sins bearing down on them. virulent manual for the self-destruction of the human race: history, salvation, truth. or is fiction today's word on sesame street?"

(not that the declaration has any legal standing.) whether an embryo or fetus is human is irrelevant. no thing, human or not, has the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter's consent.

sarc,906,"yada yada yada.... jesus was a pretty nice fellow (and god) but you don't believe him either, so what's the point? you'll get your evidence soon enough."
sarc,907,"originally posted by easyrider: (to: shooterandproud) did i take you to raise?  you're not from around here, are you?  what it means is that i'm not obligated to wet nurse / answer all the follies of dedicated christ-bashers."
sarc,908,you never voted for a democrat? well i'm glad i'm not blinded by faith like you! emoticonxangel a counter man at the local napa store who took good care of my parts needs ran for school board years ago (a democrat) and ~i~ voted for him!!!! am i an independent thinker or what? :p
sarc,909,"so the terrorists have been funneling perfectly good bomb money into american politics to help the democrats get elected, right mr. conspiracy theorist? i suppose the terrorists are planting bogus information so that those awful news reporters will lie to the american people, too? (oh, wait, that's the bush administration doing that, not the terrorists...) if you hate me, and i hate terrorists, don't you see any possible way that the 21st century communications (news reporting and money transfer) could cause terrorists to benefit you? after all, the enemy of your enemy is your friend, right? see, marc, when your logic is as asinine as this, it can 'show' anything. neat how democrats are all now atheists. but then, according to marc, so are catholics, jews, muslims, mormons..."
sarc,910,you really have no idea what a argument is? i do find it amusing you will lose every argument you get into with your significent other.
sarc,911,"you ever see those plympton cartoons? where someone's head blows up like a balloon, and their eyes pop out, and then their head collapses in on itself until it looks like a burnt match stick? that's what your post just did to me. it was a fascinating mental experience; so thanks for that, anyway."
sarc,912,"so was dominating and enslaving of women. doesn't mean we should do it just because it has historicity.  actually i've heard this idea by numerous people, on both sides of the issue. i can see the merits myself--give couples' benefits in a way that doesn't utilize a cultural and religious institution that has nothing to do with legality to begin with. that way at least cultural marriage doesn't have to be redefined to any extent and legal benefits would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group's cultural and ideological views.  by the way, what do you mean by 'anti-gay' in your phrase 'anti-gay people'? that's always important to nail down."
sarc,913,i see your point. you wanna see mine? can you point to the point...if there is one? i've seen lots of points on scoreboards. do party hats count as points? (some of them indeed are pointed.)
sarc,914,"i take it you just think this man/woman's a looney then?  it's quite convenient that the bad spirits are living in such a highly narrow minded society. they can do what they want to people, screw them up etc...and what happens to the poor souls? they get sent to a mental institute! lol  'but i did see it, im not mental!' 'yeah sure you did!' bang, there goes any creditable eyewitnesses. he/she is simply crazy and locked up. if you can't physically prove it with science then you're crazy. if you can't explain it, it doesn't exist...yeah right."
sarc,915,"'on site'? so your going to build h2 production plants in everybody's garage? how do you plan on pressurizing the h2 in your garage? do you plan on including a near absolute zero refrigerator to be part of the system or are you going to require that everyone have $1million worth of explosion-proof handling equipment, storage tanks, etc.,? emoticonxconfused and i apologize if i'm wed to the laws of chemistry and physics. it's just so darn hard for me, a trained scientist practicing my trade for 30 years, to ignore them.emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,916,and i am a clump of human cell with shoes on...what is your point? no. you seem to refuse the idea that 'human' as a noun is used to describe a human being meaning the entity as a whole and not the individual cells that make it up. i am sorry you don't understand this but the word means what it means. i find it odd that you even care what you call a fetus anyway. your sperm is a human now? you should invest in a biology book.
sarc,917,"i'm back!! had to re-visit the real world. anyway, how is it that you say i'm confused about my sexuality, because i don't approve of gay marriage?! that is weak! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. i'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. but you on the other hand must be confused."
sarc,918,"i would agree with you, but first of all, the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras. second, it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do. they have no buisness doing that. very funny, but just because men don't want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and pis, does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women. its simply a hobby. men don't insist on following women around, watching everything they buy and everything they do, do they? men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures. our rights are going out the window fast."
sarc,919,** so i don't like your lies and deliberate distortions. do i have to admire your mendacity? live with the fact that my opinion of your personal integrity is so low that i'd rather ignore you completely from now on.
sarc,920,"what sort of evidence would convert you? not only is requiring '100% proof' asinine, holding the action of the supernatural as the null hypothesis is fallaciously illogical (i.e. god of the gaps fallacy). if the christian god is real, why do two out of every three people reject it? see why this doesn't work? your approach is another fallacy, argumentum ad populum (appeal to the people). if the planets really do revolve around the sun, how come galileo was the only one who believed it? i guess the planets didn't revolve around the sun until that last person needed to make the majority switched his belief..."
sarc,921,"does that matter? isn't it obvious? you get your friends to vote you for and it allegedly makes every single one of our failures in the debate no longer matter. exoneration through popularity. quite stupid really, but what can you expect?"
sarc,922,"ever heard of the good old 'i caught a fish this big' story, and others similar to it? that's what happened here. it is perfectly logical to assume that someone witnessed a large flood, and over time it all got blown out of proportion and became the ludicroud claim of the entire world flooding and a man making a boat (which is pretty much incapable of actually floating and surviving a flood) and carrying two of every animal. with each telling of a story, things are changed and added and exaggerated - that's just common sense."
sarc,923,that's pretty damn funny comming from you. if i am wrong why do you have countless threads that have been abandoned after you encountered people who refuted you? i don't play shotgun with frauds. look up gulliable in the dictionary. http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/ch/ch710_1.html try again. basilio uchuya and his wife admit to drawing them to sell to tourists based on comic books. you fell for a tourists scheme! how amusing.
sarc,924,"is hillary clinton a truthful politician? perhaps 'truthful politician' is an oxymoron. if her robust commentary on the iranian regime isn't just an attempt to appease (some) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency, then she should state what 'clear and unequivocal' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran. i don't think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours, if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend (some) democratic sentiment. james."
sarc,925,"hey, archangel, i notice you didn't respond to the points i made - no argument, huh? to quote jyoshu: 'well since you didn't address my points, i'll assume you're done! a simple 'ok, i concede that ... and moving on back to the issues ...' ***jyoshu well, everyone, looks like our ez/ss clone has finally realized his argument was wrong."
sarc,926,"back to the blame us first, are we? stick to terrorist-supporting iran today. and even if we did, two wrongs still don't make a right."
sarc,927,"greetings? these day here abouts, which are these internet forums the plentifully existing posters, nature robots are inside. only early did today deliberator form notes on estland! few can be interested it, little the posters here in such goings on.  he spoke that about the country, again in tremendous fascism descends and asks for people of the sympathetic consideration to resist it. so the surplus, which, swollen high flown long eye is burned through, is typical from its ilk, without direction of the delimitation and the little direction. i hope that you have in enjoyed this of her one of small language in the answer of cheek, nevertheless that the a lot of praise for this prosa extraordinary should go babelfish!"
sarc,928,"they sure do, and make sure that there are all those women priests and women cardinals that have a say in the politics of the church. when they sealed the room to choose this current pope, how many women were in that room? when they were discussing the publication of the last catchiesm, how many women participated? it's easy to pray to a non-corporial image, because that image won't talk back and heavens forbid, give an opinion."
sarc,929,"and what are the choices of the so called 'pro-life' people? suffer through a rape or incest induced pregnancy, die from pregnancy complications without a chance of terminating it, or force women who took proper precautions which failed to go through an unwanted pregnancy while likely losing her job, scholarships, any chance at life, etc. some great choices there emoticonxrolleyes i'd swear the whole group of them have an underlying misogynistic syndrome."
sarc,930,"human is defined by whether or not you have a funeral, included in the census, and pay something to the state? a homeless illegal alien is screwed."
sarc,931,"the hate you're spewing is palpable, yet you can't even see that can you ? hypocrites, ya gotta luv em. emoticonxgood  you should know, you're the definition of obnoxious. you libs believe in free speech as long as the person speaking agrees with you. makes for some pretty boring debate without those of us who are right, if you ask me. :) more to the point, if the secular humanists can hijack our public schools in order to make political statements, why can't the other side protest by not participating ? again, you believe in free speech as long as everyone agrees with you huh ? when they don't then they must be hatemongers ? it's so typical of the liberal mental disorder it boggles the mind."
sarc,932,"social darwinism? survival of the fittest?  i'm sure that you could find a more obscure scenario than that if you really tried, jito. or are you saying that nearly 1/3 of all women of childbearing age are mentally unstable? emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,933,"yeah, like the guy running from classroom to classroom killing at will. you think banning guns will prevent criminals from getting them? i was going to say that you live in your own little world, but then i realized the sad reality was that you are in this world stealing my oxygen.  what? either try that again, or find someone who can translate. i kinda thought that the insecure, paranoid people were the ones who were afraid to step up and take responsibility for their own safety and security. i don't need to carry a gun, i could just roll over and die like so many others when faced with an assailant intent on killing me. i choose however to take responsibility for my safety and security, and as such, want to carry a gun. there is a difference."
sarc,934,"but the question is can you prove your belief system is true? and all you've done is spew hate for religion but haven't even tried to actually answer the question. and ask yourself this. if the idea of god is such a man made plague, then god doesn't even exist right ? so if god doesn't exist then what has he done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? i challenge you to come up with a rational answer."
sarc,935,"not really. what was once consider metaphysical fantasies are actually physical phenomena.  so you don't actually believe if that science cannot prove it, it doesn't exist?  well duh. the supernatural exists outside the field of study. science cannot prove nor disprove the supernatural. it can disprove something that was previously considered supernatural as natural. that does not mean it does not exist.  what makes you say that? virtually all myths came from a truth.  is science the world?  can science measure forgiveness? how about hope? how love? according to you, since they defy the logical criteria of science, they therefore cannot exist?"
sarc,936,"you mean pascals sucker bet? if arch is wrong, he's wasted a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood, a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their 'flocks'. he's prevented himself from exploring the wonderful opprotunities this limited life has to offer for the nebulous promises that come after death is assured.  furthermore, he's extolling others to do so also. because misery needs company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous beliefs they hold, they need numbers to validate their wastes and servitude."
sarc,937,"gad!!! is there no end to 'low' this putz can go?? horrible. and what's worse, he routinely damages the testimony of genuine christians with his antics."
sarc,938,"and who was on vacation when the memo from intelligence forewarned about the impending attack???? oh yes...george w. bush. who left the american troops in saudi araba??? oh yes....george herbert walker bush. whose father was a banker for adolph hitler...oh yes, again ghw bush."
sarc,939,"'i have been crucified with christ; it is no longer i who live, but christ lives in me; and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god, who loved me and gave himself for me. gal.2:20 let me guess, you are an albino and a member of opus dei? seem plausible considering that you seem to enjoy pain and suffering as your religion and apparently have sworn off earthly pleasures like learning new information and understanding what goes on around you while you still can. oh well to each his own. the round church will pray for you at our next meeting (alternate tuesdays when we play fizbin).emoticonxangel"
sarc,940,"if you want more downs syndrome children entering the world, why don't you take care of them? what have you ever done for these children? oh that's right, you'd rather just sermonise about how 90% of people are 'hard-hearted'."
sarc,941,"let's look up all the definitions, shall we? here's where you got 'yours': as you can see, the definition you cited is only used once, and even then it is just one of two from that source.  i notice you ignored all of the responses to you on the thread and decide to just post this piece of work without answering people. we are waiting, oh sentient one. we have shown you creatures that match all of these definitions (or at least all of the definitions that are seen in each and every source - see how alike each one is?) - now show us how humans are the only sentient beings in the universe."
sarc,942,"what the heck? owning an airport is evil now???  it is becoming clear at this point that you're pretty much grabbing at anything you possibly can, no matter how silly, to bash jerry falwell. he did enough bad things to where you don't need to resort to the benign things, to bash him. the man is gone. you don't have to worry about him anymore. move on."
sarc,943,"so why have darwinists ignored symbiosis for decades if it was so compatible? same with developmental biology? why have developmental biologists been locked away in closets, never to be heard from until recently when they've forced themselves upon the scientific community? the reality is you have no choice: accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else. tell me though: do you now admit that individuals evolve, not populations?"
sarc,944,"absolute nonsense. nope, not at all. go read the relevant paper again. utter garbage. 'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned. so do you have a measure of complexity for a genome without reference to the external environment? really? what is that measure? you're entitled to your groundless opinion on anything, including parasites. yes i am, and i ought to be. i earned the right by doing original research on the topic of host-parasite relations as exlempified by chemical communications between them. did rather nice work at that. the core paper is still cited rather often even after 30 years."
sarc,945,"i just spat coffee on my new monitor...  wanna catch a movie, sinjin? i'll get the popcorn if you'll bring that yellow salt..."
sarc,946,"your truth?? your truth???? does it come in singles or in a bundle? do i get some sort of discount for being agnostic, that's halfway between theist and atheist, ja? does it cost extra to buy the 'be judgmental and condescending, and you will enter heaven' version, or can i just buy the 'i have so many flaws, but when they are exposed or i'm out of hand, i'll just fall back on jesus, and that makes me perfect and whole' one? nah, i'll be satisfied with 'the truth that i know is truth, not faith. let's just skip the faith process.' that hits the spot!"
sarc,947,"let's see, shall we? if you continue this claim or yours, you lose all credibility - you're no better than archangel if you continue this."
sarc,948,"my dad would sometimes talk about such things. one particular 'ditty' went something like this: at the gates of heaven :- god: i'm sorry, but you led a life full of sin. i cannot allow you into the kingdom of heaven. sinner: but god, how can you deny me entrance. you made me like this. you should have known that i would do all those things. how could i not? god: i'm sorry, but you just didn't try hard enough. back then it really meant something. and i suppose it still does today (other than me not really believing in this omnipresent biblical character). it just means that you should try your hardest to do the right thing. now all you have to do is work out what is the right thing. smiley"
sarc,949,"** nonsense. who's been teaching you your quantum physics?!? ** the reason is called, 'ex nihilo, nihil fit'. what you are saying is called 'magick'. ** which would mean that it came from some where or something and did not 'just happen'. ** a 'quantum fluxuation'(sic)?!? is that some kind of magical cosmological dump, or something?! materialists inventing magic words, or using real words as magical mantras and bumper stickers in oprder to make up for what they haven't got, is getting really old around here. ** so why not call your 'multiverse' , 'god', and be done with it?"
sarc,950,"so have the trillions of dollars that have already been 'redistributed upward' since the reagan/gramm deregulation mania helped end poverty? or has it created a dependent class of ultra rich people unable to function without a taxpayer bailout? that sword, my shonda friend, cuts both ways."
sarc,951,"so let me get this straight, you would violate a womans civil rights to save a fertilized egg, but have no problem killing real people? wow."
sarc,952,"are you so incompetent you can't look up dominionism and reconstructionism on the net? hell, if i posted the links, you wouldn't read them anyway. emoticonxbanghead"
sarc,953,"miller case did nothing to defend the militia claim of the gun control people. the court ruled sawed off shot guns are not used in the military. if it had ruled people cannot own sawed off shot guns, then why can you still buy them?  does this also apply to the people that want gun control laws!? you know like when you said you hated inbred rednecks! why is it people that talk about talk about tolerance are the least tolerant people? practice what you preach!"
sarc,954,lol...well why don't you use your brain and tell me how and why breasts formed then. why would they get selected for in the first place? ns can't see into the future. have any evidence of a reptile with breasts?
sarc,955,"tendencies.  whether it is ok to act upon a 'tendency' may depend upon whether the outcome of that activity is favorable or not. we have lots more tendencies, like kindness, generosity, playfulness. these are good ones. why is it you lumped 'homosexuality, violence, alcohol/substance abuse' together? the last two are mostly bad things, but 'one of those things is not like the other'. homosexuality is just as good or bad as blue eyes or lefthandedness. we all have a 'tendency' toward sexual behavior that aligns with our sexual orientation. heteros 'tend' to want to do it with the opposite sex and homos with the same sex. i am not sure i understand your point here."
sarc,956,"steve if i thought i could help you i would. i was called on using incorrect facts and your shooting out words like bagillion? you need to know when you in a dream. reality is scary i understand that.  i can't make a blind man see steve, if i could i would. seems you can't make an aware man sleep as well."
sarc,957,"ask yourself why siblings marrying shouldn't be totally legal under all circumstances if the religious right has their way with an amendment stating that marriage is between a man and a woman. funny how the same 'argument' can be used just as easily against you, isn't it? sorry, archie, but it's called the slippery slope fallacy for a reason. the fact that you continue to use fallacies in your arguments really doesn't help whatever positive reputation you have left on this board.  even jyoshu, who agrees to not having gay marriage just as you do has argued against your fallacious arguments. and thanks, by the way, jyoshu for showing some strenght in character in your post criticising archies hate-filed posts. suprisingly that give me a lot of respect for you."
sarc,958,"it's actually not a fundie site, it is a catholic site, tradition in action. in the 'about us': not exactly where i would first think of looking for information about human sexuality.  but that's me. hey, arch, have you ever considered getting scientific information from a scientific source??? just a thought."
sarc,959,"doh, you used the 'l' word. how dare ye! (tsk, tsk) :p don't you know? you can't use the term 'lifestyle,' you have to use the description of lifestyle instead. that usually works much better. gotta know the rules to talk with the gay rights folk here, don't ya know? lol see, if you use the word, they can't stay on topic and so then your use of the 'l' word becomes the topic. it's just too damn distracting for 'em."
sarc,960,"two reasons: first, i come from a jewish family, and i've never heard of this before. now, i'll grant that nothing says that i should have, but this is news to me. second, and more importantly, trebor is not the person who made the positive claim; you are. it is your burden of proof. no one here can blame me for questioning your bare assertions given your history with falsehoods. so if he doesn't respond in a mere three hours, you declare victory? how about you call me presumptuous again? emoticonxrolleyes for once you acknowledge that you aren't able to back up your claim. congratulations. try it next time without accusing somebody of being cowardly and misleading."
sarc,961,"i tell ya what, move 100 lightyears from earth, now look at it with a telescope. see anything made by man, computers for example? human bodies? ok now come back to earth and look at where you were. see any bodies, any computers, any life? well do ya?"
sarc,962,"fend not really. they took it out because it was a blatant pro-christian argument.  and those two threads only serve to prove my point. the only iders are fundamentalists christians or muslims. there is no science in id. only godiddit.  explain to me how the same processes that date geological areas that are used by evolution and the big fossil fuel corporations is wrong.  explain to me how its correct when the fossil fuel industry uses it to find fossil fuels but when scientists use it to support evolution, it's false. that makes no sense whatsoever.  explain to me why something tried and true needs to be reformatted. or are all these products science brought us fake?  the delusion of creation."
sarc,963,"lol, really jim? you mean, all a gov't has to do is pass a bill in its legislature and it justifies whatever actions they undertake outside its borders? sweet. i'm gonna start lobbying today to get a bill passed through the house of commons, the 'jim's trucking liberation act'. once it's passed, i'll be completely legally justified in taking all that you have, by force if necessary. i'll start there, but if that goes well, i might aim for the 'usa liberation act', i wouldn't mind having a few vacation properties in the good ol' us of a. i can see all my fellow canadians really getting on board with this too, it's so easy, and only requires a stroke of the pen! waxy"
sarc,964,"ooh lucy herself. so tell me, just out of curiosity, how do they know how much hair to put on her life size image? i notice she isn't that furry at all. how'd they figure that out from just a few bones? let's see, what do they call people like you at the carnival booths? oh that's right, an easy mark. have you read any other good fairy tales lately pandion, besides lucy that is."
sarc,965,if i say murder is ok and you say it should be illegal the do i get to call you a bigot? you need to read the post better. i said if it can be changed then it is not innate. you said that skin color can be changed and it was innate. well you have yet to show how this is true. you saying it is about as equal as me saying you are wrong. i read 'environmental factors'...it doesn't say what this equates to and you have not shown where it does. there is no fact being voted on...only public policy.
sarc,966,"honk! wrong. my parents inherited a house from their parents. they also inherited knowledge and were taught certain values. concepts stored in one brain, expressed via words and encoded in a new brain. epigenetic inheritance, yet still materialistic. doesn't mean they didn't also inherit a bunch of genes, and for the umpteenth time it doesn't mean they get to screw their face up like hiro and tweak them whenever they like. shouldn't i be asking you that, since that's what you say happens, despite having exactly zero evidence to back it up? honk! what a great big fat juicy lie, ss. don't put it in the keep net though; toss it back so you can use it again later."
sarc,967,"not to mention his world view which believes math is atheism. remember, it was tq who based him on his inability to do math and arch replied directly that t.q's worldview was atheistic.  i do find it funny how someone who thinks that grammar is dependent upon the person saying a statement rather than the statement is criticizing someone over spelling.  i think i'll intentionally misspell words and then capitalize the incorrect letters just to annoy him. maybe he'll finally get something right pointing out something i intentionally did wrong?  it is funny how arch can't respond to what i actually wrote.  disagree with arch in any way and you hate christianity and god. insane, but that's arch."
sarc,968,"dunno... feind seems to be a german surname. perhaps a feindslayer is someone who goes around killing people named feind? i'm happy being viewed as a fiend, however. not so easily slayed! ;)"
sarc,969,"hmm so all you guys have achieved is make a bad situation in iraq infinitely worse and you ask the reasons why the whole world hate you? go to iraq and ask the people there what do they think of you and take the whole class with you including the teacher. so how would you reign in the militias, what is your method the world would probably not approve of?"
sarc,970,"well, i wasn't looking to derail the conversation, but since you are... i will continue to point out these instances to you. they happen often enough that it shouldn't be hard. perhaps once you see how often these 'misunderstandings' occur, the one's where people say that you're delibertately misunderstanding them, you'll, i don't know, stop doing it so much? we'll see."
sarc,971,what part about 'what i am going to do is use my influence to convince politicians to pass common sense gun-control laws' do you not understand? can you understand plain english? i said nothing about personally going to your property and taking away your guns. suppose someone wanted the speed limit to be lowered. kelvin's argument against that would be like this- 'do you really believe that? do you really believe it so much that you would be willing to die for your belief? then run out in the middle of the road when you see a speeding car and hope that when the driver sees you he/she will slow down. don't ask anyone else to do it. risk your own life by running out in the middle of the road.'
sarc,972,"< yawn > you going to get to the topic or what? isn't there another thread you can create to talk about this 'issue' you are so fixated on? the only real 'non-interest' here is in you not even talking about what this thread is about. i have an interest in a variety of threads, and talk repeatedly on them on the actual subject matter. the fact that i say other things you object to on those threads is not a logical reason to conclude a lack of interest. also, considering i have challenged you to a moderated debate, which would obviously include somebody curbing any conduct that violates the rules, it would again show interest. the fact that you refuse to respond to such a challenge shows that you are the non-interested party. not me... emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,973,"you sure fooled me about that!  well, actually, i have.  it's no more than a restatement and expansion of previous points i've already made.  well, you'll have to forgive my occasional rhetorical flourishes and hyperboles. not a few religious believers have exasperated me as total xxxxxx, but i do realise that not every believer in a religion is a total idiot... ;) that is a 'simple fact'? it doesn't seem so very simple to me, and i am not sure how you would establish it as a fact. but yes, i accept that most theists assume their god is eternal and not limited by the natural laws that limit them. i'm just dubious how rational an assumption it is."
sarc,974,business is a purely private association. you mean like interracial marriage? 'social harm' is just another term for 'things i personally find distasteful'.
sarc,975,"what? why should i have to prove that anything doesn't exist? i simply don't believe anything there's no evidence for. why should i have to prove that everything there is no evidence for doesn't exist? because a lot of it might hurt me? there's no evidence of an invisible pteratactyl behind my head about to eat my brain. do i need to prove it doesn't exist?  you must have have heard about the onus being on the person making an assertion to prove it, not the other way around. i could assert there's an invisible spaceship on my lawn. it leaves no imprint on the grass and you can walk right through it. now prove it doesn't exist, archangel. go on. prove it!"
sarc,976,"why am i not surprised at your lack of a response to my point? why am i not surprised that you're supplying no evidence? and there are millions of bedrooms with people gettin' busy inside, too. can we rail against those as well? in bed, with their partners. you're married and you still don't know where this generally happens?"
sarc,977,"so that means i can't call a godless heathen a godless heathen on a debate forum in the 21st century? do you see how ridiculous you sound? or is this bunk just par for the course for you people? of course we all know it is. you are all too happy to create 2 sets of rules here. it is just fine for you atheists to condemn everything i represent but if i as a believer in christ give the other side of the coin, i'm breaking some imaginary rules and going to hell? emoticonxgood emoticonxsmilie emoticonxsmilie emoticonxsmilie you all oughta be on stage jito, the first one outa town that is."
sarc,978,"since archie's posts are content free, might i suggest they be response free as well? he isn't here to debate or discuss or even explain; he's here to rant and insult. every response just gives him one more opening to do so, i ask that people stop giving him that opening. just my opinion of course, do as you will. it's just tedious seeing thread after thread driven off track and into the mud."
sarc,979,"we'd have define consensus first. if it is 50% + 1 then there probably is one. then after that, who is saying they are wrong? prejudice as its finest. lesz likes to stereotype people to an extreme that can never be changed. i have never told lesz my views on global warming and lesz has shown no interest in gathering facts about what others believe."
sarc,980,"are you telling me you cannot figure out how creating a gay-hostile atmosphere causes and condones anti-gay bullying? forsooth! butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, would it."
sarc,981,"by me, not 'lyte.  who said you're hateful to foreigners? i said you use that as an excuse to pooh-pooh away differing opinions, as in 'oh, you can't understand, you're not american.'. you've done it numerous times, but not always. as you should have. itwas done to show how illogical your 'common sense' reasons were for suspecting 'lyte and i were the same person. because we've used the same words and phrases occassionally, and because we tend to agree on most subjects, does not mean we are the same person. just as it doesn't mean you and aa are the same person. following me here marc? as does anyone who confuses 'lyte and i."
sarc,982,really? is the aaas a non-scientific organization too? hope you don't read the journal science because it isn't good enough for you.  you just choose to attack the source because it disagrees with your viewpoint. don't let science get in the way of your fanatic beliefs. emoticonxgood  if it isn't a peer-reviewed journal than why does it have to be reviewed by two experts in the field? why is the journal associated with the aaas? why do you attack the source and not offer one that supports your view? is it because you can't provide evidence for any claim you make or because you enjoy the taste of sand? keep digging that hole dane.
sarc,983,are you done spamming and threatening me with admin? that's just lame and pathetic.
sarc,984,"did someone hack your account, oblivious? you sound like a fsb bot in this post..."
sarc,985,"since your denying it so strenuously, i can only conclude you therefore support the right of gays to marry the partner of their choice and to enjoy the same benefits you and your spouse enjoy. or was there some other portion of my post that is contradictory to your beliefs? aw, how cute! archie learnt a new word: projecting. how is what i said 'projecting' archie?"
sarc,986,"are you always this reactive? short-sightedness. feasibility in terms of winning a nomination. but not necessarily a national election. and being suckered by the right into thinking that they actually like you -- because your health plan is more laissez-faire than clinton's ... meaning it's business as usual if you did win. but you won't. because we'll like any republican better. did you really think we were going to keep on saying nice things about you? my regards to your texas cousin, cnxtime. emoticonxgood  but i already know you pubbies are shakin' in your amarillo boots should hillary and the clinton machine be what you face instead come november. mccain, born '36 clinton, born '47 obama, born '61"
sarc,987,"your last post? this one: so, let me get this straight-you're evidence that the toe is based on lies and deceptions is: 1) you said it's based on lies and deceptions; 2) you know better; (those first two are my favorites, btw) 3) it's based on unprovable assumptions (which you've never managed to provide, despite numerous requests to do so); 4) it's constantly changed as new data emerges (i'll just point out here that that is how all science works) yep, i'm convinced. oh, not that you're right, but that you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. i'm also convinced that my previous post was correct in what you define a 'lie' as."
sarc,988,"this is called extremist logic. first of all sams cost millions of dollars and people who can afford them probably can't afford that many, secondly these rich d00ds probably like thier freedom and would not be so inclined to use them. 3rdly how many individuals do you know can afford a billion dollar nuclear arms program and build, posses, and maintain a nuclear weapon? this is absurd rationing from the land of make believe.  but to answer your question if the government can own it so should the people."
sarc,989,"look around, the greatest majority of gun-related violence occurs were people aren't allowed to be armed, or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed. this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing, putting them in an near-absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want. and the point is what exactly in this statement? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered. after the teachers became armed these rates dropped. why? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second's notice."
sarc,990,"because gc hears things all woggly. the message from god is for shepherds to tend to ignorant, mindless sheep. but, with dope-smoker ears, and american ignorance it translates into a cowboy...who rustles cattle...and heads them to a quick slaughter. it's like, when the anti-chist makes his appearance, i'll be gods slaughterman. effectively and efficiently removing tru-believahs from the world...cause god forgot some in his rapture thingy (i forget how the logic of these events is supposed to play out...) ummm...aren't we overdue for that bloke to return already? i'm getting antsy for the 2nd coming and all the excitement that leads up to that glorious event. think holding my breath will make it happen any sooner?"
sarc,991,"'define'? as if it's a definition? tell me, archie: precisely how ignorant of this topic are you? so you want me to give you the better part of what could amount to a semester-long advanced college course in a single post? do you really think that you'll understand curvature of space-time as induced by matter when you can't even understand the difference between a scientific theory and a drunken guess? do you really think i have any inclination of trying to tell you about the technicalities of relativity when you don't understand that light and gamma rays are the same thing? get real. you need to get your head out of your xxx before you'll be able to even hear me."
sarc,992,"you're not a bigot, all gays really are 'touchy, judgmental and bitchy'? classic! seriously, debate over, archie loses in one. obviously archie won't see it that way, but does anyone else disagree?"
sarc,993,"wonder where all our resident hypocrisy-police people are who jump up and cry 'hypocrisy!!!' whenever a 'family-values guy' messes up? funny, they don't seem to be so eager to call out hypocrisy in this case ...."
sarc,994,"none of them which are correct.  how about you address my points? oh wait, you won't because you need to maintain your fantasy land where everyone who disagrees with you is an atheist.  how can you attack me when you won't even read the links given to you?"
sarc,995,"got anything more than your opinion that proves scientifically that the athletes will be completely safe and breathing pristine air with the factories shut down 2 weeks before the games start, and only half the cars taken off the road each day? i mean, it took a decade or more before the la basin declared victory over the dangerous pollutants that prevented asthmatics from going outside on certain days after we attacked the same problem back in the 70s. so don't you think it's a tad naive to think everything will be honky dory after 2 short weeks with these limited actions? and don't forget the neighbors the link mentions and their unending pollutants that will continue to come in on those same winds."
sarc,996,"could it be that they've finally realized that there is no viable argument for gun control in a country that was built on freedom to bear arms? each time the control-lobby comes up with an argument....they get shot to pieces. (laugh out loud!) it is interesting to note that both of the democratic front-runners for 2008 favor gun control. with the recent death of charlton heston, there's a weakness in the armor of the nra. i would go on a handgun buying spree, but i already have enough guns and ammo to stave off a thousand or so government guntakers at a place we call 'the little alamo'."
sarc,997,"as to the first part, i answered you above. regarding the second part; what in the world are you talking about? girls who are born from unfertilized eggs? and boys born of virgin mothers? can you post any evidence of these cases? beside jesus of course, because we know his father is god and that he possesses the holy spirit."
sarc,998,"have you ever even heard of www.google.com? http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=...e+search&meta= and this is your measure of what makes something true? well then, the epic of gilgamesh, the illiad, and the oddysey must also be true by that reasoning. they've survived just as long, and are still being studied to this day for their insights into those ancient cultures."
sarc,999,"are you completely incapable of making sense? penfold used deliberately obtuse language. this language was then explained to you. now you are arguing that 'turn the other cheek' is completely different, and in no way similar, to 'revolve/rotate' the other cheek. if you turn something, you revolve or rotate it. you're so busy being affronted by what people say that you come off as even more simple than they try to make you appear."
sarc,1000,"so a ballot initiative that allowed the citizens of the state to vote on the issue was illegal?!?!? what dictatorship do you live in that makes a ballot initiative unconstitutional? oh yeah, i forgot, the district of whatever the poor oppressed gay militants want. so screw the will of the people, just buy the judges and rule through judicial activism."

sarc,1002,"shooterandproud: hey, here's a novel idea, what about the man using contraception!?! don't tell me there are men so ignorant in this country that they don't know what the trojan dispenser in the men's bathroom is for!"
sarc,1003,"but it makes you look a fool that you make comments without knowing. doesn't it. so you think that just because you enter a debate half-way, you can still give an uninformed opinion? weren't you the one ready to laugh at me? i won't laugh at you. i am only saddened by your personal attacks. yes, repeating yourself. i know what they say, you know what they say. i don't agree with them, on these points. answers in genesis are 'right' by your account on this occasion - see my previous post about us both being 'selective' in the information we use; again a lack of insight into your own thought processes. i disagree with them. do you agree with their claim that speciation in fact disproves evolution? i bet you've been very selective here too!"

sarc,1006,bwhahaaa....this is unreal. precrime? seriously? minority report? and guns magically turn people into 'bad guys'? hum...good to know. and its funny: we will remove the temptation of a lethal weapon by enforcing new laws via our own lethal weapons.  you people are freaking retarded.
sarc,1007,"are there doctrines of red hair? 1.so now you can spew your filth about the 'evils' of christianity, but i can't say anything about atheism? when did atheism become so great? at least i'm corteous enough not to shout it out to the world. but there seems to be no way in atheism that you would be that corteous. emoticonxwow"
sarc,1008,"oh really? maybe in canada that'll fly, but that isn't what quotation marks mean down here. but of course you lefties just write the rules as you go and expect the rest of us to automatically get it, huh? no tq, all he had to say was 'so called christ killers' if that's what he meant to say. he was making an absolute statement and he was attributing it to what christians believe. it was hateful, bigoted and prejudicial against the jews. not to mention inaccurate as the crucifixion was a uniquely roman form of execution. so don't make excuses for him, you degrade yourself to lie for someone like him who just attacks christians without thinking."
sarc,1009,he screamed and insulted and threw his literature at the vice president of pride. and you once again snipet and reword my posts by taking them out of context to serve your own irrational and bigoted thought process. oh and dont accuse your community? what are you some holy leader? get off of your self rightous high horse and get a clue! and how is my community rising above your 'communities' bigotry and and slander? by having pride movements like these and standing up for ourselves.
sarc,1010,"maybe david just wanted to participate in some slaughtering too? anyway. the commandment says 'to not covet your neighbors ***.' most of my neighbors have hairy ones so it's easy not to covet them. well, there's that and the fact that i'm no gay... but, there are a couple of opposing gender neighbors who's back sides i do covet. does that mean i should get killeded? oh, wait...when they said ***, they meant mule/donkey like animal? huh. whodathunkit? shoulda kept it in it's original language then.  i guess it's okay for me to covet christina's rump? since she's not married and all. just so long as she doesn't covet mine...cause i am. emoticonxangel"
sarc,1011,"yes. probably because they're not using chi right. about the boxer, i don't really know. however, i have seen people use chi in other ways. how would you explain the stunts that my master does sometimes? the whole standing on one leg thing, or the rebar thing? i know its not a trick, so what is it? i didn't think finger muscles were capable of bending rebar."
sarc,1012,query: why do they call the followers of gush limpbutt the addict 'dittoheads'? answer: they have no ideas of their own. think gush & cindy have the same supplier?  now there's a capitalist we all can admire!!

sarc,1018,really? i never miss the chance to tell everyone that i'm going to heaven? i challenge you to quote me ever bragging that i'm going to heaven and you're not. what i have done is promised you mockers and scoffers that the day will come when you will learn the truth about how wrong you are to reject the living god. but never have i boasted that i am going to heaven while you're not. and never has my motivation for promising you that you will ultimately learn the truth been to make such a point. so quote my posts kronus. prove me wrong and defend your lying claim. and i want links to posts in context to the debate and point being made at the time.
sarc,1019,"yep. and look at those goalposts flying across the field: so we go from showing where he ever did this to showing where he did it five times. and if five examples are provided? well, show me ten! and if ten are provided, he'll want at least half of his post count (roughly 2500). why? the point has been made, the challenge he himself laid out has been met. still waiting for the proof i'm lying archie. want to head on back to that other thread and show where i lied?"
sarc,1020,"i know i'm presenting facts to archie, sorry... archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. the theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. we know life exists. darwin, and others, explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place, they simply knew that it came from somewhere. how did they know it came from somewhere? because there's life here now! the answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after darwin. so no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis. evolution doesn't care where life came from, only what happens to it once it's around."
sarc,1021,"oh sure, try to take the high road now. but have you forgotten the labels you have so freely placed on us as supporters of mcstain, as you have labeled him? does the term pulling a kronus mean anything to you? because you define it with posts like this, as you now seek to ditch the offensive labels like this: (hard right religious radical fringe) http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...ain#post322462. and this: http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...t321807emoticonxgood"
sarc,1022,"ah, not a problem then i read up on that rev. wright affair, and it looked to me like it was spun pretty hard. if by racist american hating nut you mean 'black guy who's tired of blacks being discriminated against and says the system needs to change', then yeah, i see your point. that's my interpretation of what he was saying, and not a subject for discussion here though. i know it's politics, but is winning more important than what's best for the country? ouch. but wouldn't it be better to have someone in there who at least knows that's how far there understanding goes and doesn't presume to know more than the people who spend their lives studying these subjects? gotcha. glad it was that one ;)"
sarc,1023,but they lack evidence as to why a first trimester fetus should be considered a 'being'. they want to change the law based on metaphysical claims attached to their religion. why don't we make it illegal to work on sunday while we're at it. and why not saturday too? and enough with the bacon already (just for good measure).
sarc,1024,"yes, as it was used in the correct context such that it made sense (referring to a bill/legislation that was being passed.  obama did not use it correctly and it was quite clear he was using it to insult palin. especially when another of his buddies in missouri on the same day made a direct mention of palin and used 'lipstick' in a same manner (said mccain was trying to cover up his 'deficiencies' but even his vp pick couldn't do it no matter how much lipstick they covered it with). hardly a coincidence, wouldn't you say? personally i see obama coming down from that high horse he has claimed to be on and has started getting dirty now that for the first time he is behind in the national polls."
sarc,1025,"you're somehow right despite the fact that all reliable evidence is on our side? what idiocy. brady, this is the most ignorant thing you've said yet. some of the stuff you bolded supports us, not you. and the rest does no good for you either."
sarc,1026,"are you one of the hard of understanding people? flyboy got it, even if his rationalisations were insufficient. even so, they were far superior to much of the dross you regurgitate."
sarc,1027,"you think metro is left wing? what the hell have you been smoking, ethmi? metro is a filthy rag from the same hideous stable as the daily mail."
sarc,1028,"no... a debased intellect has things backwards, that would clearly be minds of your ilk buddy. so.. what then? your heart tells you to go jump off a cliff? on contrast that old you book you claim tells me to sit down and live a day, guess what i'm gonna do? go live a day... and avoid watching them have to scrape you off the ground. that old book is about reason, respect, love decency and standards that preserve life... a fallen heart cannot be trusted. i trust a heart governed by that book... rather than a mind with no self control living for the 'heart' - they give heart a bad name. sorry pal... i dont' expect you to understand it, and i am fine with that - it is your choice, but it hasn't been wrong ever, and never wronged anybody."
sarc,1029,nice thought. a pity you did not live in the third reich. emoticonxfrazzled if they were captured in the battlefield then they should be treated according to the geneva convention.  and if they were found in a hole then why did you remove from there? and please tell us of the 'intelligence' they supplied the only 'intelligence' they supplied was to be used in how to perfect techniques in torturing in which medical doctors participated just as the doctors in nazi germany. doctors are creepy.
sarc,1030,"thanks for the admission that you lied. btw, some of you think that mcstain gave up nothing of importance after being tortured in north vietnam. if that be the case, how can you be sure that any of the iraqis who were waterboarded or tortured in other ways gave up anything valuable? wait, i have it, the americans are better at torture than anyone else. sick!!!"
sarc,1031,"bs, if it's password protected, then how would they access it? then i suppose america would look lovely as the crater in the death star! you're telling me to believe that it exists even though there is no evidence that it does? once again: there's a witness in this courtroom who says that i didn't kill that guy, but i'm the only one who can see him and hear him. in other words, unless the page is showed to me, i have no reason to believe that it exists."
sarc,1032,so a vote for an adulterous divorcee is a vote for morality? is this election being held in wonderland? i'm pretty sure mccain falls foul on bearing false witness as well.
sarc,1033,"do you seriously mean to suggest that the entire campaign, election, and inauguration would have taken place under the scrutiny of the world without this vital discovery being made? if so, it looks as though you and phelps both set bells to ringing when you pass by. the bells say, 'bong, bong, bong!!"
sarc,1034,"by changing the subject. just because you reply doesn't mean you don't change the subject. i could reply with gibberish. you apparently missed the post where you claimed that creationwiki had refuted talkorigins. as talkorigins supports the toh, and since you think that that to is incorrect, well, you do the math.  do you know what a question is? in the english langauge, a question is meant to gain clarification. my question clearly did not accuse you of saying such, only requesting clarification to whether or not you believed creationists used dishonest tactics. perhaps you should enroll in a english comprehension course at your local college?  see above. google is a good tool for finding such classes.  keep insulting me. not only will it get you warnings, but it keeps proving my point.  you have no argument. only insults."
sarc,1035,"to review. we have this piece of wonderful news stating that we cannot keep illegal products out of the country, and we should just give up and quit.    major panel: drug war failed; legalize marijuana  new jobs program by sinjin for the mexican drug cartels. inport illegal guns in too.    and this news from a country much like ours.   australia. with much much more gun control than you want at this particular moment, and they still have the illegal gun problem.  and yet you still insist on laying this off on our constitution? the probability of success is zero, and you know it! so what is your real reason for burdening the constitution? ooooo! ooooo! i know! you dont like it!  isnt that what you told charlie?"
sarc,1036,"what about all of the school killings that have involved use of revolvers, shotguns, and ieds? what's your p***ing away excuse for instances like these? in reality school shootings are linked to them being target rich environments where nobody can mount any opposition to the deranged killer. it's like a wolf in the chicken coop."
sarc,1037,"you do know that it is a) easy to register and b) the site admin is a christian, don't you? you won't go there because the moderation is strict about sticking to the topic and insults. these things seem to be part of your weapon load out, here."
sarc,1038,"welcome to creationistland, where chemical reactions can't be explained or predicted unless we know the origin of the atoms involved. do these people check the labels of all of their food before they eat so that the fruit from bulgaria actually has an impact on their bodies? must be a problem to eat at a restaurant. 'excuse me, sir, but can you tell me where this chicken was raised? if you don't tell me, then i won't get any protein from it.'"
sarc,1039,"i would ask you for a link, but this time i'm not feeling generous.  didn't you know that there are about 2.5 million cases of gun self defence annually, in about 92% of those cases nobody was harmed? does this even compare to the microscopic 102,200 deaths (don't tell me that's, wrong thats the very number that your cult has been using, comrade) that the brady fanatics have been whining about? your stats are simply untrue."
sarc,1040,"how is pointing out that terms can be misapplied an indication of contradiction?!? we are always free to disregard the standard of application for a term. that doesn't mean that such usage is correct. and in fact, the idea of a correct usage presupposes that the standard is something non-subjective. perhaps of the two of us, i'm not the one who misunderstood what i wrote? and yet, they're not. infants have been born; fetuses have not. because birth is the dividing line. how often does it need to be said?"
sarc,1041,"as steve martin once said, 'well, ecuuuuuuse meeeee'. no polar icecaps today? ok what is the proper - pc terminology - that refers to the big chunk of ice, what sits over the top of the north and south regions of the planet? as long as it is not too long of a description or too lame - i can evolve to the next phase and say ...(thus and such)... instead. :) btw. iam sure that algore can remember the meaning of - 'polar icecaps'. sorry that, you can not."
sarc,1042,"so is matthew your friggin' loon!  are you really that far gone that you can't see the point that everyone here is trying to drill through that thick brainwashed skull of yours? all any of your posts boil down to is 'i'm right because i can't be wrong'. what utter bs. and the sad thing is, you have absolutely no idea. you are utterly incapable of viewing things from another perspective. you can't even understand the possibility that there is another perspective."
sarc,1043,"i'm not 'claiming victory' after going off track to an unrelated topic. what i am addressing is related because i am saying it is irrelevant. how is that not related? in fact, this is another example of you changing the subject matter. to point out that they are irrelevant. i thought that was clear."
sarc,1044,where did jesus get his magic powers from? btw if angels could do the baby mama drama before the flood then god can too.
sarc,1045,"oh, so business owners don't make 'real' contributions to society? whoa boy, slow down there. i didn't say that government offices should be passed down. what are you going to do...make inheritence illegal? you didn't read my answer obviously. just because people have money doesn't mean they have to share it. the government doesn't have the right to take money away from the rich and give it to the poor. so what if rich people don't give money to the poor! it's their choice. god tells us to give money to the poor, but he also gave us a free will. it's not the governments responsibility to help the poor, it's the church's responsibility."
sarc,1046,"quick objection to the movie analogy: that analogy holds true when god takes the role of the observer, as you might in a movie. but what if he wrote the script? he wrote all your lines and you played your part perfectly. then he gets to watch it. no free will there."
sarc,1047,"what a pitiful quotation. is there something that you try to achieve with that? you're attempting to say that all who are christian are illogical, which i find just plain silly. are you not aware of the great minds who proclaimed their belief in god? plus, is that the image you want to portray for yourself? what a great person who slanders of religions. the great atheist himself! could you explain why you think that?"
sarc,1048,"making sweeping judgments against homosexuals and atheists, with no real knowledge of their situation? archie has no problem. but when it comes to christianity, the obfuscational ploy of 'i don't know all the details' comes out, followed promptly by a thorough lack of concern for finding out any additional details. she is blatantly violating her religion in doing so. the bible lays out exclusive reasons for 'divorce'. this isn't one of them. this is yet another example of religious intolerance, even to the extent of violating their own religion."

sarc,1057,"another question that shouild be answered is . . . if the bible says that noah and a few members of his family were the only ones to survive this 'global' flood, how come there are so many other accounts of others surviving a flood? did god miss the target (that being the whole of humanity)? genesis 6:13 (new international version) 13 so god said to noah, 'i am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. i am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. presumably he also knew from the beginning of time that he was going to make this great big ####-up. how embarrassing!"

sarc,1060,"how are you proving that when you have gone out of your way to ignore your failures?  tell me, does comic book art prove creationism? does tv props prove creationism? is oil a hydrocarbon? is density sorting in a fluid medium 'ludicrous?' does a theory that requires miracles work on a scientific level?  how is 'why' the same as 'what?' and since when does grammar depend on the person saying it rather than the statement being said? you claimed that taz did not screw up the grammar, yet i did. yet the statements were identical. how are you addressing what i said when you've completely ignored everything i listed?  more yelling. no actual argument.  the whole point of that was to show you make large numbers of asinine statements. do you reject that?  red bold statements don't make a winning argument."
sarc,1061,"ummmmmmm, because it was built in 1932-1935, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the founders or early government leaders, nor with what they believed was correct? you really are the master of the art of self-pwn, archie."

sarc,1063,"and mythology. you forgot mythology. for example, the two stories of creation were probably two popular folk myths. and the story of the flood is actually two versions of the myth that are intermixed. and, of course, the stories of job and of jonah are pure mythology. do you know what logic is? comparing the moral mythology of noah to a parable is an analogy, not logic. the myths of noah are not history. and since we are talking about noah, i see you bailed on the thread where the pyramids of egypt were being discussed. and yet you refer to this obvious myth as history."

sarc,1071,"not true at all. hate crime legislation protects straights as well as gays. nothing 'special' there. so you make a claim, but can provide no example to document the veracity of your claim. meh... what i expected. the ruling is garbage.

sarc,1235,"True until proven otherwise eh? Xcaliber and you must get along great.You have things backward and you are probably being confused by the 'experiment to falsify a theory', that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved.No logician (and by extension no good scientist) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof.Oh right theories are never proven, so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this -> 'an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true'."

sarc,1264,"I'm not interested in who isn't hitting on you. Do you want an ugly, flaming, gay cellulite blubber-wench hitting on you for three years or not??? Or maybe a pod of those whales all hitting on you??For the record, gays make normal men's skin crawl, and not in a good way. So keep the spiritually-challenged heathens out of the men's barracks, and out of their showers. Just because you and the rest of the pro-gay crowd thinks that kind of depraved activity is ok doesn't mean the rest of society does."

sarc,1270,So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.

sarc,1275,"lol. Thanks for agreeing with me. I stated as you quoted that it did not work. Where again where you trying to attack me?

Hey, if it's the Macy's in New York, thirty-five dollars would be just giving it away.

When it was proven that Sanford did indeed run on family values, you changed your argument. Instead of just owning up and admitting that, you weasel out of it. "
sarc,1283,So your political thinking is 40 years out of date? That does explain quite a bit.
sarc,1284,"Ah, so I don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that I have to support McCain's statement. Are you serious? That sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. I also find it funny that you claim that I don't like democracy when my very post stated that I would be voting for the Democrat party.

sarc,1291,"Nice try, but no cigar. I never said that inflation had no effect. Of course it does. But even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1960s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run-up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago. My beef has been the resident ""experts"" here who flout their supposed knowledge and money to impress us lesser mortals who reminded them of the iron law of supply and demand.

sarc,1314,"Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians."

I'm not sure what the numbers are. I think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.2.

So that makes it ok for her to sin and leave Christ? That's absolutely the most lame excuse I've heard yet. On the other hand, it might just appear she's choosing bi-sexuality over Christ, which isn't a good plan either. And you're sticking up for that folly.

Some people (You) think that a Jewish person who believes in Jesus is no longer a Jew. But what could possibly be more Jewish than believing in the Jewish Messiah, Yeshua? But anyway, that is NOT the point, the point is the same as I made before: The fact that there are Messianic Jews shows exactly what I was outlining in the top post.

notsarc,1439,"so what? jefferson is a prime example in opposites and double standards. he believed in freedom but owned slaves. wrote the declaration of independence yet only believed in freedom for white men not women or people of color. this stance is very consistent with his double standard. he was also an adulterous, womanizer who had sex with his slave women and producing children who would remain slaves. so there again is his double standard he enslaved his own children."
notsarc,1440,"along with some others here, you have missed the point. i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons. i don't really care how much money they have. more power to them for being filthy rich. a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his (and spouse's) tax returns. teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention. why?  is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry's chances of even being nominated? this has nothing to do with the average citizen."
notsarc,1441,"what if the dog has a mind of its own and isnt really feeling inspired to chase the ducks out? pakistan is not our servant, and we dont have them on a leash like that. they have their own agenda and priorities. and while they do help out from time to time, our total dependence on their actions puts us at an obviously disadvantaged position. if our action in the hunt for al qaeda sums up to sitting by waiting and hoping that the pakistanis do the actual hunting, then basically we're doing nothing"
notsarc,1442,"it would only be inconsistant is i had abortions for those reasons.  others do things i don't approve of all the time. if i don't approve of you owning a gun but i believe in your right to, am i inconsistent? believing in the right and approving of the action are two different things."
notsarc,1443,"how are they different? both can lead to depression, impaired judgement and decrease in ability. what is the difference? you can't just claim they are completely different and leave it at that. how are they different? you say i fail to provide how sleep [loss] can be just as violent as drugs. you or epaphras_faith have yet to prove that drugs can cause violence. i have just proved that sleep loss causes a decrease in ability and impairs judgement and leads to depression. you haven't proven anything more that drugs does."

notsarc,1445,"you all seem to miss the point, it is not about hiv/aids. if is was the poster would have posted more about education, or about prevention. he didn't. his motivation was to say all gays are diseases. if you say that all women make up 70% of new cases, does it mean that all women are hiv postive. of course not. but that is the light he shed on it. if he were to have said 70% of all crime is committed by non-whites. would it have been ay different? it is not about what he posted, it is about why!"

notsarc,1448,"isn't predestination incompatible with the idea of free will ? calvinist doctrine, in its pristine form, had a theory of predestination in which only the 'elect' were, from an original principle, 'guaranteed' salvation and everybody else doomed to a spiritual void. i'm not sure that even joining the calvinist cult (voluntarily) would allow you to be counted among the elect. after exposure to the gospels, people either choose to follow christ or not for a huge number of reasons, emotional factors, etc., etc. as a rational agent, wouldn't the choice ultimately be an exercise of free will ?"
notsarc,1449,"is that why when everyone turned their back to bush to cheer the couple, bush just sat there with his hands folded looking impatient? what was really sickening to me was when everyone put ink on their fingers. they totally cheapened the bravery of the iraqis. none of these pissants waited in line where they might be shot. they didn't walk home hoping no one would see the ink and kill them. and they certainly aren't in the middle of the war. it was truly sick for them to have that ink on their fingers."

notsarc,1465,take it up with who brought it up. who said the idea of it being 'scientific' is the criteria for a theory to be taught in schools?  schools have to have some degree of autonomy to have the curriculum they want without over-regulation. who sets the standard of what's 'scientific' or not?

notsarc,1469,"you have to be kidding me. you don't really believe this, do you??? sure they may have white people on from time to time, but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people. so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a 'single culture' behind it? i don't see why having a culture behind it is really relevant. things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there."
notsarc,1470,"i thought he considered everyone who didn't adhere to his views as the same? jews, muslims, catholics etc. were all just as bad in his eyes iirc. -wez"
notsarc,1471,"up to a point, but ther are things some people would consider 'wrong' that others would not. for example, most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong, while most non-muslims would not. some people believe it is wrong to hit someone, whether or not they have hit you, others believe you have a right to retaliate. some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage, others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok. all of these are moral issues. which view should schools teach? should they teach that killing people is wrong? how about stealing? should they put things in context, so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property. should they conflate morality with law? that opens yet another can of worms."
notsarc,1472,"[quote=sigma]any number, even the 1000 figure touted, is most likely incorrect. there just isn't enough data to make a solid claim.

notsarc,1475,"that is strange the last i read bin laden absolutely hates the regime in iran, mainly becasue iran is run by the shia and bin laden is a sunni.  so iran should be held accountable for actions of bin laden ? it seems like before(iraq) people are trying to conjure up links between the real terrorist threat(aq) and unrelated nation."
notsarc,1476,"daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation."
notsarc,1477,"now you are just playing games. you claimed the institution isn't being harmed. i said it really is--what else would you call it if the instution as we know would be done away with? the evidence is that if the institution as we know it is done away with for something else, it will no be there anymore. that's how it's harmed. if marriage is opened up to change everytime a group with a different sort of relationship comes along wanting it to be redefined, it would become something much more open-ended, broadened to meaninglessness. if that's not damage to an institution, i don't know what is."
notsarc,1478,then where do rights come from and how do you know they exist? i commented on the part i felt needed to be commented on.
notsarc,1479,"sure, no doubt. but, there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you don't get pregnant. the obvious way is not to have sex, but i know you won't settle for abstinance as an answer. that's way too religious for this site i suppose. obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children. if someone doesn't want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation (abortion) to remove the possibility, why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex? this is true within marriage as well."

notsarc,1484,"yea...i'd say we're on a downhill slide. do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations (like 99%) lose information, lose specificity? mutations are destructive entities. they demolish and break down what was there. granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information. and since selection works on the level of the whole organism, it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level. not only that, but natural selection has an i.q. of exactly zero -- as do random mutations -- so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward. and if the only way for the genome to go is downward, then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong. it's not just unlikely...it's not just improbably -- it's dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected."
notsarc,1485,but you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage? i have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom. if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way. would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way? it is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage.
notsarc,1486,"i think your post brings up a good point, and that's that to discuss torture, there needs to be a good understanding of what constitutes torture.  what are we talking about, exactly? just listening to loud music? loud music at 125 db 24/7 resulting in sleep deprivation? physical torture? or how about humiliation, like forced nakedness? simple prisoner punishment? having to eat a different diet? i think some things could be torture and some not, depending on the person being tortured, as well. it's a complicated subject--too complicated just to throw out some all-inclusive word like 'torture' and be able to adequately discuss it."

notsarc,1494,"that's an interesting observation. by what means are you reasonably sure? do you think the other religions have the same take on it as you do? i used to think the same: if there is only one god, then they had to be worshipping the same, just giving him different names. then i was introduced to matt.7. clearly god only wants identifying (ex.6:3, 15:3 etc.) and worshipping one way, therefore all other religions have to be wrong. just a thought."

notsarc,1499,"i've spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity. what more do you want? blood? look, i disagree with the entire concept of religion. my view is that when religious believers support something that's right, they do it despite their religion, because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts, not religious ones. maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism. all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice!"

notsarc,1504,"of course i know that i could be wrong but i would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement, not just claims. have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong? either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. perhaps you are having a 'senior moment' and don't remember our discussion. i really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. if you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. if you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then i think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement."

notsarc,1509,"i think you're missing the point. why would you want to keep people under control? to prevent them from harming other people. the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions. they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well, and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time (not modern, ancient). it was a good idea, however people started looking past the 'love thy neighbor' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion. so, my question is why is homosexuality a sin?"
notsarc,1510,"how does this change the fact that it was a defeat? guns had an effect, i don't doubt that they would - but not enough. i was using a tactic known as 'using omega's own arguments against himself'. i think that a gun ban would have a drastic effect on gun ownership levels. you have often disagreed. i'm just pointing out it's logically inconsistent for you to maintain both arguments."

notsarc,1516,"simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately."
notsarc,1517,"well can you point to an instance, either in canada or the united kingdom, where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes? i'm not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse, or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys, i'm talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others. can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings?"

sarc,1547,"'force our beliefs'? did we kick down some people's doors or something? you're quite deranged, you know. if i as a christian, with other folks like me, decide to vote to outlaw gay marriage, and we prevail, then that's constitutional. and if we have enough votes we can even legally do an amendment to the constitution declaring gay sex illegal in america. that would be constitutional also. the taliban doesn't like people voting and will instill their beliefs by force, not be ballot. and that's where your thinking is deranged. and dan savage is a hypocrite and is also deranged. that would be chapter 1 of romans for the sodomites to review."
sarc,1548,"apparently you need to read up on up-to-date cases of fetus viability and premature birth success statistics. that's right, and she does it after the baby is born by caring for it as well. so? i guess you'd also be in favor of it being legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she has to care for it after it's born too, with that reasoning. there are many, many women in the pro-life movement. my wife is one of them and she is a lot more passionate about it than i am. (trust me, you don't want to be in a room with her after you've killed a baby!) if you think this is a men versus women issue, you are sadly mistaken."
sarc,1549,i am looking for you to recognize that a pregnancy can't successfully happen without addressing the circumstances of the mother - whatever those may be. you can dismiss everything but health/life of the mother but i can pretty damned well assure you she won't. and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can't succeed without her. get it? she is not a barbie you can bend to your will with law. do you see her? do you recognize that babies grow and live inside women? address all her issues or you will fail in your endeavors. oh - and i don't require your sympathy - my life is great.

sarc,1557,"yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. i should debate him on .... what? and here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. he was insulting; you remained stony silent. because he denies that darwin ever used it. darwin did. small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this) what is evolution? what is evidence? well that would be a first time. but why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? you made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? why your sudden interest in digging all posts i've responded too?"
sarc,1558,"i agree, let him rest in peace. however... this disgusts me! how can you say his good deeds outweigh his anti-gay sentiments? i could pass out money and food to the poor and homeless, cure cancer, invent the longer lasting lightbulb, and run around shouting racial slurs at blacks while fighting to take away their rights. but hey, at least the good that i did outweighs the last part right? it's not like i am the grand-dragon of the klan right? sure, intolerance and bigotry are ok as long as you do good things to outweigh them. emoticonxrolleyes i am certainly not trying to spit on his grave...but 5 good acts do not erase 1 bad act. oppresion against anyone is not a christian value...or so i heard."

sarc,1562,"yes, yes, im completely asinine. how does that improve your position? asinine or not, you have no logical rejoinder. please explain why you dont tithe. ted bundy killed young women; you failed to tithe. explain the difference according to your take on morality. you still have no answer. months and months to prepare, and here you are still unprepared. your pretense is typically human. you left your considered answer in your other suit. come. come. are we really to believe that if you could present an argument that you wouldnt? the problem is not my asininity, but that your belief in morals is an illusion. simple question: why dont you tithe?"

sarc,1568,"wow, that's a huge blanket statement which you haven't bothered to qualify. guess that means it's just a personal attack because you had no better argument, huh?  just because someone does not like what society has become does not necessarily mean one hates the concept of structural society. unfortunately you haven't qualified either concept in your ad hominem attack of jake."
sarc,1569,"ok, i'll repeat what duo_maxwell has said, that you are a facist. why are you so insulted by being called that? if it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it must be a facist. we moderates are proud to be moderates, why don't you like to be called what you truly are? same logic here, right?"

sarc,1593,"what did i previously tell you, i.e. well hey, moose, you're in a topic which highly relates to the bible. if you want a secular response there's plenty of those guys around. if you want to chat with me i'll usually be coming from a biblical perspective. but i'll be glad to talk with you on a secular subject if you want. what are you looking for? p.s. please hold your 'honest attempts at discussion' rants, ok? i could easily claim the same with you since you are out of god's wisdom. but i won't. what did you want to know? again, what did you want to know?"
sarc,1594,"but my definition is one that conforms to reality. i have to, because you never seem to do too well. in fact, if you had bothered to pay attention to my explanation of my use of the word ignorance in post 195, you'd have realized that i meant not 'utter stupidity' but rather 'lack of knowledge' (in your case due to completely ignoring all disliked points). instead, you simply proved my point. what's this, yet another non-response with a thinly-veiled ad hominem attack? now everyone can see why i have to answer my own posts..."
sarc,1595,"since you are so oblivious to the truth, and probably flunked science a couple of times: http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/essays/courtenay1.htm http://newton.nap.edu/html/creationism/evidence.html http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/the%20...g%20theory.htm http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm fact listen: [ fkt ] n.  knowledge or information based on real occurrences: an account based on fact; a blur of fact and fancy.  a. something demonstrated to exist or known to have existed: genetic engineering is now a fact. that chaucer was a real person is an undisputed fact. see above. http://www.carm.org/abortion/embryo.htm a piece of my hair is of the homo sapein species too. does that mean my hair is a person? perhaps you need to get your 'facts' straight."
sarc,1596,"thats total baloney. one has nothing to do with the other. you are trying to confuse the subject with this drivel. when a powerful leader makes a decision peoples lives are effected. bush decision hurt people, period. why? so he can have the luxury of compliance with his silly religious beliefs."
sarc,1597,"so you agree simple foreknowledge is not determinism in the way i explained it? if so, can you explain that to electrolyte, who is having a terrible time coming to grips with that? he has omnipotent foreknowledge about future events, is the way i would put it."
sarc,1598,"that is an utter contradiction. he knows what is going to happen, but wants to preserve our freedom of choice? what freedom? please, explain so i can understand, this 'freedom' which gives rise to only one possible future! the existence of a god who can see the future implies we have no choice in shaping our destiny. no ifs, buts or maybes. this isn't about god deciding our future, it's about whether we can. well, that's one interpretation. another would be 'not sticking our heads in the sand'."
sarc,1599,"''they'll come up with hundreds, sometimes even thousands of products relating to homosexuality [and promotion of] the agenda of the homosexual community,' sharp told christian publication agape.' i would be fascintaed, and probably highly amused, to see what products they think are promoting the homosexual agenda. it would probably be a wonderful peek inside their rather twisted little minds. i mean, what are they talking about? astroglide? silk boxers? potted ferns? the mind boggles at what they might be afraid of here. oh noes! my son just saw a teletubbies tape on that rack, now he's going to catch gayness!!"
sarc,1600,"then why do you respond? the ignore function works quite well. 'if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out.' violence on screen or in real life is pornographic!"
sarc,1601,"are you telling me that my pubes are sentient? i agree, however i am no constitutional expert."
sarc,1602,any idea on when this will happen? i want to buy a cheaply made house when it hits rock bottom...on the water....from the bank that took the foreclosed house and is selling it for three times less than what was paid for it. :)
sarc,1603,"are you kidding? uh, i hate wasting my 1000th post on you, but here goes. i don't believe that the pm was vile and profane, because jitobear doesn't do that unless you get her really ###### off. second, you're not the most credible person on this forum. and no one has lost it. maybe in your mind, but not in reality. is this how you react when you're cornered, when your bible rhetoric fails? because its kind of pathetic."
sarc,1604,"would you rather have them be born with down's or not? it all depends on what comes out of the mothers, well, you know. whether it has down's or not is the question. i believe that abortion a couple of cells is not killing anyone, that that a new mental existence would be born in its place. therefore if a defective cell or two was aborted, and the parents decided to have a new baby and carry it to term, in my eyes they are the same baby, since one didn't have a mental existence."
sarc,1605,"and your kids go to private school yes? so you want higher teen pregnancy, more abortions and more sexually transmitted diseases?  if you are disagreeing with my statement that you want all of those lower, then you are admitting you either want them to increase or stay the same. as you have railed against abortion, it would appear you're being contradictory. make up your mind. and yet they have lower rates. funny how that works.  no. in the seven years since introduction 620,000 or so european women have used it. so that's around 88,000 abortions a year. 1.2 million happen in the us annually. as the population of europe is around the same as the us, it's not a valid point. 88k to 1.2 million is nothing.  plan b isn't abortion. try me."
sarc,1606,are you serious? emoticonxwow you might have to explain that one to me.
sarc,1607,"no, you didn't. in fact, you are only semi-literate and you are now lying in an effort to make it seem as if it were intentional. isn't lying a sin? so your intent was to make christians look like fools? good job! whether it is wrong isn't the point. the 'quote' is only semi-literate and should be embarrassing. sadly, semi-literacy is rarely embarrassing to creationists. that's nonsense. maybe if it wasn't semi-literate and didn't make me look like a fool. or even if it had some actual meaning. but not a foolish statement that conflates evolution with atheism and rocks. atheism, rocks, and evolution are unrelated. to try to relate them as some logical position is either dismally ignorant or completely stupid. hey, but no one ever accused a creationists of being smart."
sarc,1608,"'lame apologetics'? well, i guess if you say so, with your invincible assurance of being right whenever you open your mouth, it would be futile to contradict you.  at least you haven't accused me of being 'prejudiced' against science.  james."
sarc,1609,"** well, that's the kind of thing a self-confessed clown would find funny. which is probably why so many of you clowns are either depressing or scary. what else amuses you? little cars, huge feet, and rubber noses? they would be on a par with chemist's offering, in terms of wit and intelligence."
sarc,1610,"'blah blah blah'? look, you weighed in here on what i said, making an issue of whether it was internal, empatically making a point that it was action. as i said, i'm basically agreeing with you on the whole thing here about there needing to be equality in this situation, so i don't know why you're being so eager to find something to disagree over here."
sarc,1611,"and yet who gets to say what god's truth is? apparently only you. anyone who disagrees with you is a damned sinner. so i really don't think i'm that far wrong here. well, one might say that only god's opinion matters in the long run, sure. but that doesn't stop the rest of us from forming opinions now, does it? and believing that you have a better grasp of the divine will than pretty much everybody else in the world? in my opinion that's about as arrogant as you can get. but since you only care what god thinks, and you get to decide what you think god thinks, i guess that doesn't bother you all that much. emoticonxgood"
sarc,1612,and i suppose they are also responsible for the evolution of utterly insane mental cases such as yourself? and for electing gbii. and for saddam hussein. and for the drought in the south currently. and for cancer and aids. and heck why stop there why not for the devil himself. all those sodomites must have become the original demons in hell i suppose.emoticonxbouncer
sarc,1613,"well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along.  careful there that ones been clearly shown to be the case - in a laboratory environment to boot. not to mention in the form of a hydrogen bomb! you mean that the planets and stars have always existed? really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the hubble telescope. so you don't believe that life had an origin! wow so you think its always been present on the earth? not even the bible goes that far! and you fail to account for the observation that there is life. thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and most creationists use the kinds thing as a support for their arguments."
sarc,1614,"hmmm. 'wow... and this op made it through the rigorous admin review process? anyway, here is a question for you to ponder about. if god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around?' sounds like a joke to me.  evc forum: human evolution (re: if evolved from apes, why still apes?) but we all know that arch is incapable of opening the blue colored links."
sarc,1615,"what are you talking about? cosmic? what do the cosmos have to do with evolution outside of causing extinctions?  and macroevolution is a observable fact.  when has that ever happened? abiogenesis is life from non-life. evolution cannot occur without life. your 'debate' and i question the use of that word is a train wreck and that's before it even gets put together. do you enjoy making up terms that no one in a respectable field has ever used? evolution is the change in allele frequencies over time. how can something that has no alleles, much less be alive be a part of evolution? again, this is a train wreck.  you actually think this is even close to being ready? hahahaha"
sarc,1616,"so, no answering argument, then. thought not. after all, why argue when flinging insults is so much easier? odd, though, that you should be so thin-skinned about others insulting you."

sarc,1619,"explain to me how a dragon would get off the ground and fly. the sheer necessary muscle would be more then the available mass of the organism as similar to the necessary requirements to merely run for a t-rex.  how many several ton animals can fly on thermals?  please, if you think you understand anything in the realm of reason, explain to us how a dragon weighing several tons could fly.  or does he need a jet engine strapped to his butt?  hahha. you're never going to hear the end of that one."

sarc,1621,"and a few posts later you whined about ad homs. maybe you could support that? perhaps you would prove to us that we are truly vile, evil, callous, despicable people that deserve to burn in the firey depths of hell for the murders that each and every one of us has committed? or perhaps you wouldn't."

(interestingly enough, one essay on that website rejects yec. who are creationists? -david dathe) why would he do such a thing if he didn't think they were the same thing?  why would he link a christian website rather than a yec website when everyone else was talking strictly about yec and not about christanity?  simple answer: he thinks the two are the same thing."

sarc,1630,"sure. god commanded faithfulness in marriage. yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid, and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened. god commanded you should not steal. yet moses' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time. god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven. so what's the deal with the ark of the covenant? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill, shortly after commanding them not to kill, well this could become a pretty long post.  i know you asked for one, but i just started rambling because so many came to mind. pick one if you want."

sarc,1634,anything that does not predict imminent catastrophe seems to irritate you doesnt it? my point is that eco worrying is not an exact science.

sarc,1639,"it's not a fallacy. cars or religion are not basic necessities. having your house put out or your fatal injury treated are, so there is no comparison. he is trying to say that the basic necessities you need in order to live should not be privatized, with the obvious exception of food. corporations can't buy the oxygen in the atmosphere, can they? i don't like the government running things either, but when private corporations are doing a worse job than any government could, its time for the government to step in."
sarc,1640,"not wrong - but your attempt to try to infer that you do not deny jesus christ has now been exposed for the world to see.  not only that, but you're a liberal, aren't you? you claim not to be a conservative, you do not oppose gay marriage, you're pro-choice; you refuse to publicly acknowledge christ as your lord and savior, so that's a flaming liberal to me.  would you like some more kool aid? :p"

Odd, but OK, I'll go with it you lying brainwashed fool (hey, this is fun! I like using Archie's compliments!).Actually, my ""sick hypothetical"" was a very valid question. I simply asked you if god commanded you to kill your neighbour for his sins, sins which you had no evidence of, would you do it. It seems like a fairly simple, straightforward question to me. Why not answer it?I see a pattern here Archie. If someone asks you a tough question about your faith, you cry ""Corrupter! Blasphemer!"" and run away. Is this your idea of ""witnessing""? Is your faith that weak? Answer my simple little question, then I will answer the same one, or another of your choosing if you'd like. Tit for tat."

sarc,1679,"What the heck did you have for breakfast today, huh? A bowl of nails and terpentine to wash it down? Talk about a foul mood. You've been to half a dozen threads just this morning launching personal attacks at everybody you come across, and most of them have something to do with 'I'm glad there aren't more people in the world like you,' or 'I hope you're the only ones the terrorists kill so we can get back to making this nation great,' blah blah blah. They invented things like Midol for moods like yours.Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make them stupid, or misguided, or immoral, or dishonest, or any of the other snipes you've been firing off. Lol, and you're telling me to not throw any hissy fits."
sarc,1680,"You of course have documentation of Darwin laying out his plan as to how to weasel evolution into classrooms to oust theism, right? No? You're making it all up? Shocking."
sarc,1681,You mean my dog 'CIgarette'??I took him out for a drag.
sarc,1682,"What! You mean that WE don't want to do all of those things? Who knew? I didn't get the memo? emoticonXConfused And you forgot ""make Seniors eat dog food"". emoticonXGood"
sarc,1683,"Did you start the thread in the hope that no one would respond to it ? Is responding to and pointing out the trolling and hypocrisy you have shown wrong ? But I congratulate you for finally admitting that this is a trolls thread. That is more than I expected from you. And as for me reinforcing your contention about conditional christian love ? I do love you my friend, I just hate what you represent which is why I express my love by correcting you and calling you on your every hypocritical contradiction. emoticonXAngel I am Archangel after all. emoticonXGood"
sarc,1684,"You're a Bush-man, aren't you, gnojek? Come on, admit it. With that stance, you'll be in the White House before sunrise.(You do realize that I was being sarcastic - right?) emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,1685,Really? Why don't you go out and start randomly hurting and killing people and see how far that argument gets you in court.
sarc,1686,"Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, ""....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically."" you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence."
sarc,1687,"No more hypocritical than somebody actively harping on me for citing the Huffington Post, but then HAVING NO negative comment for the RNC embracing NewsMax...But here's an idea.You probably wouldn't vote for me cause I cited Huffington Post, right?So logically, one should ALSO NOT VOTE for Republicans who embrace NewsMax, right???emoticonXDonnoNah. I don't expect that kind of consistency..."
sarc,1688,"Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means? Also that's what jeans were called before the word ""jeans' entered the venacular. (Do you know what that word means?) So, now are you going to tell me that only homosexuals have larger vocabularies? Get a life...and preferably not mine...I'm living it at the moment."
sarc,1689,He killed thousands of failed athletes? I must have missed this in the news.
sarc,1690,"Then you should be able to post some numbers that show I am wrong. I had absolutely no problem whatsoever finding and posting numbers that show I am wrong.Whipping? Are you on crack, easy? You and your buddy have been completely smacked down here. You have spewed a bunch of rhetoric and BS and been repeatedly shut down with hard FACT.Why dont you go get a high school diploma so you can at least understand basic math...heck...for that matter, a grade school diploma would ensure you had all the math skills to understand how silly your position is in the face of the facts."
sarc,1691,Does she shampoo your beard and iron your turban too? Towel head.
sarc,1692,You want to explain to me what the age of consent was in 1st century Palestine?And rejoicing really sounds like fear and intimidation to me. emoticonXRolleyes
sarc,1693,"What prompted this?I guess I need to check what website I'm in...Your response, Orion, (like trs) is that of a gutless, spineless, dip-wad. One who would tinkle in your drawers if you made such a claim while facing me. But, I've dealt with your sorry, trashy kind before and have found that no matter what is said, you'll act like you're ten foot tall and bulletproof.But, carry on, Orion. You've shown your true colors now. Cluck at will... emoticonXChicken emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,1694,"Did you slip in it AGAIN? Were you led astray by a passage from Heller you thought you could use to legitimize gun control, your wet dream?I submit from many past rulings of the courts that little statement is in error."
sarc,1695,"This will kill innovation. do you know how many years a start up business might be in the red before it generates a profit? Why bother when you know you are going to be clubbed as soon as you realize a profit? Yep, way to incentivize business there..."
sarc,1696,"I typically don't read Antonia's propaganda pieces, so is she holding up the UK as a shining example of dental health? If so, I suggest that she ask a typical Brit to smile, so she can see for herself the folly in such an assertion. The US' ""bubbas"" have better teeth than the average Brit. emoticonXRolleyes"
sarc,1697,I have an entire New Testament. You've got what - a mouthful of denial? When you get to the level of the NT works let us know.
sarc,1698,"Tell me genius, how is me accurately and correctly pointing out your mistake colluding to misdirect anyone? Either you are again using words you don't know the meaning of to make such an inaccurate statement, or you're just lying. So which is it penfold, are you ignorant or just being dishonest again? emoticonXConfused"
sarc,1699,"So you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents? Perhaps you would support a balance then. Given what you say here, you wouldn't think it a bad idea for the New Hampshire School System to take a field trip to the local Catholic church would you? You know, so kids can know what resources, agencies, and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future.The School Board apparently gets the message, however. According to the article, it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter, and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary. I would think it is."
sarc,1700,"Now settle down charlie, and try to think rationally, just for a second. Have you ever heard of a tumor growing into a sentient life form as a fetus does? I'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally's."
sarc,1701,The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.
sarc,1702,"And I didn't. Did you note how I explicitly put [Jesus said] for the first two quotes from the Bible, but not for the third one? Any idea why? Come on, think ... you can do it!"

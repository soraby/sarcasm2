notsarc,1,"have no predators to fear? check. who said we don't have predators? we have predators. a human's predator is another human. they may not haunt you for food but loads of them will be more than happy to kill you for many other reasons.  in the wild you can also be eaten by all sorts of other predators. you see, when you look at it from the other side, our animal predators have no problem at all eating us... your response to this so far has been 'yes but animals don't understand that it is wrong'. in other words, animals don't have the mental capacity to see death from the same 'morally unacceptable' perspective you see it from. and yet you are still trying to project your hung ups about death onto them."
notsarc,2,"2 hours? damn!  that book took me a good 2 days, it was a good book but i found it extremely slow. then again i never like books i have to read for school =)"
notsarc,3,you never played myst? damn!!! i must be really old ;)
notsarc,4,"Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone ""up there"" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify. "
notsarc,5,"Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion, misrepresentation, and dishonesty. I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things... (I figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)In fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. Unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it. "
notsarc,6,"That's is ridiculously poor logic. Simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do. "
notsarc,7,"Well, many have argued that if you don't except a literal Genesis, you're damned. Perhaps not in this particular thread, but the arguments are esentially the same. I believe that the theological implications of that position are fair game for discussing the validity of creationism. "
notsarc,8,"Believe me, marc, we certainly can. The fact that it damns your argument is no skin off our backs. In fact, it damns your argument so much that the producers know it. See below. "
notsarc,9,"darling, i'm in the 10th year of my committed relationship. and since i haven't seen anything approaching his perfection, i think not. but thank you, though. i asked the question because enquiring minds want to know...if you have a 'hair stylist', ifn you not gay, then you metro. you don't want the label, then don't divulge that bit of info."
notsarc,10,"anyone who serves in the military is a hero. once you sign on the dotted line and take that oath, you are allowing for the possibility for death by combat at anytime. perhaps others didn't get the recognition she got, but that's not her fault. the media needed a 'darling of enduring freedom' poster child and she got picked."
notsarc,11,"his lies, his media darling status, my post above answers your question for you."
notsarc,12,"you're a darling, j. coulda used you here earlier, though, to straighten this mess out. as far as 'stalking' goes, btw, my first appearance here was 11/08/94 (the same day i told those on the ny times board about this forum. ) the poster in question (infamous on the same board, though he pretends not to be) first appeared on 11/16/04. who's stalking whom?"
notsarc,13,"darling, it isn't an analogy at all. as duo correctly observed, it is a counter. when faced with a choice between human life and animal life, one should not automatically choose the human. why is abortion worse than eating bacon and eggs? because we like babies more. not because human life is worth more, or more valuable in any way, just because we like babies more.  personally, when faced with the choice of buying dog food or sponsoring a child in africa, i choose to feed my dog. because i like my dog more than i like people i don't know."
notsarc,14,"*shudder* for whom the bell tolls might be the most horrid book ever devised. junior year english took a lot out of me. an excerpt from the book, paraphrased to the best of my memory: 'darling.' 'yes.' 'i love you.' 'oh.' 'do you?' yes.' 'you love me.' 'i love you.' 'let's hide. in this cave. while the war goes on. and die. alone. in the rain.' 'wait.' 'what?' 'how do we die alone? we're together.' 'oh yeah.' 'i love you.' 'i love you too.' my god, i wanted to tear my eyes out. so instead, i just stopped reading it. ;)  who wrote timeline? i just finished the pelican brief, by john grisham. what an amazing book."
notsarc,15,"that's just darling, and all. but it still doesn't indicate that a fetus is a small person. no one denies it's alive. no one denies it is of the species homo sapiens. no one denies that an embryo can ultimately become as person, which is the simplistic point of that cloying article. it is personhood of the fetus that is the debate. i don't think it can ever be definitively determined.  using dr. seuss was an excellent choice of reference to back your argument, however. i am not sure why you quoted shooter's post about a death sentence. however, if you really equate abortion with murder, are you willing to advocate charging the mother and doctor with premeditated murder?"
notsarc,16,"thomas jefferson, often the darling of the liberal left, once had this to offer: sect. xiv. whosoever shall be guilty of rape, polygamy, or sodomy with man or woman, shall be punished; if a man, by castration, a woman, by boring through the cartilage ofher nose a hole of one half inch in diameter at the least. - a bill for proportioning crimes and punishments"
notsarc,17,"sigh - - don't care - - and tossing around bible verses and insulting people when debater disagrees with you is? darling, all you do is alienate them."
notsarc,18,"translation: i didn't say there was no fighting in our lovely scotland, what i meant was that there's lower crime (e.g. than most parts of america). alright jimmy? (alright jimmy = scotish saying) you should go to glasgow (in scotland), they'll show you what a glasgow kiss is (glasgow has a lot of rough areas and the glasgow kiss is a head butt) ps, we don't speak like that no more, alright darling? (you are quoting very old scotish dialogue there). lol"
notsarc,19,"the gospels are awash with inconsistencies, not least when it comes to the resurrection. (i vaguely remember reading that someone has put forth an on-going--and as far as i know, still unmet--$50,000 challenge to anyone who can come up with a version that successfully satisfies the descriptions given in all four versions.) a wonderful rebuttal to an ez-esque biblical literalist named montgomery (apparently a darling of evangelicals) by an atheist lawyer can be found here: http://www.bowness.demon.co.uk/trial.htm it's highly enjoyable reading, and i commend it to one and all."
notsarc,20,"obama is just a trojan horse for mccain to win. there is no choice, it's an illusion. indeed, the entire democratic party has become a trojan horse for the republicans. pity. if they were smart, they'd unite behind the edwards/clinton health plan which is backed by many reputable democratic party senate members, medical professionals, and noted economists. in the meantime, whoever wins the nomination, i won't support them if they don't (get behind it). mr. obama, darling of the republicans, and health care chicken. 'no we can't.' with 18,000 americans dead every year on american soil. well, mr. obama, there are moral mandates: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ow9ydlliy8 and with every other wealthy nation on this planet managing (and much poorer than ours), yes, we can."
notsarc,21,"no darling, nobody has mentioned all those things but since you mentioned them ... yes, a baby could be a terrible incovenience in obtaining all those things you want, sorry need, such as education, a job, a secure financial future, feeling safe, makings your dreams come true etc etc etc. if your uterus is your greatest gift, then be careful to whom you give it, namely keep your legs crossed until mr righy shows up. :)"
notsarc,22,"if i'm spamming a petition, then you're spamming paul krugman, darling. and i've put up plenty of rational arguments with citations. you, on the other hand, have yet to propose one reason why single payer is ridiculous. because we elect representatives to do what we say, not what the lobbyists bribe them to do. you still haven't said anything besides 'stupid', 'ridiculous', and 'maoist' or 'socialist', which is usually what people say about the few politicians who aren't on the take. emoticonxgood"
notsarc,23,"lazy jason, darling, but you very sadly lack one item of attractiveness, the freshness and beauty of innocence."
notsarc,24,"simone darling, please stop. your making yourself look foolish. your trying to compare uniformed soldiers in an organized military under civilian gov't control to terrorists. there is no comparison to be made here, even you should be able to see that. huh? the u.s. military dismantled some of our bases in saudi arabia based on a prearranged schedule at the behest of the saudi government. it had nothing to do with 'capitulating to the taliban', nor did we remove all of our bases. yes simone, we still have military bases in saudi arabia."
notsarc,25,gitmo is a media darling. nobody talks about abu ghraib. and it is still in operation see what the obama admin thinks about closing that one. not a fucking word. enjoy the grandstanding.
notsarc,26,"you calling me a diseased freak ?  oh , darling . thats okay . we will forever and ever be married . but now you have to buy me a new pillow"
notsarc,27,"because all children should have parents who want them dearly.btw, ""moral relativism"" is absurd. a phase people pass through as they discover diversity and is bewildered by it, thinking all are equally valid. it is a stance of both immature/superficial reasoning and moral depravity. "
notsarc,28,"Actually, I've been posting more than ever...just not here. This place has become gay central and it bored me. I posted the above because I knew it was a topic near and dear to both of our hearts. emoticon_xkill emoticon_xgood "
notsarc,29,"Oh deary me, no. Where do I even start?The bacteria and enzymes in your gut and intestinal tract that digest food are every bit as microscopic, and they thrive on specific compounds, not elements. Sugars and fats are plain old carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. You could get exactly the same atoms into your body by drinking water and eating graphite - and you'd die. Can you digest cellulose? No - but other animals can, because they have enzymes that can break it down. It's still all just carbon, oxygen and hydrogen - but that's like saying everybody's front door key is just 'brass'. It isn't the fact that it's brass that unlocks your door, it's the shape it's formed into :) "
notsarc,30,"Here is what fascinates me about the judgmental criticism you offer of my opinion. In typical fashion you make claims which you don't support at all. Here is my post below, point out WITH EVIDENCE!!! what I am distorting in any way; especially that which I hold dear. In other words, write a cogent and rational post which makes sense when applied to the quoted post it intends to attack. emoticonXDonno "
notsarc,31,"Then you freely admit that you lied when you said this, and I quote: People like Arch are setting it as opposed to science and in that position it will be doomed to fail.   AND   Arch is doing nothing but distorting the very thing he holds so dear, I mean, how is accurately quoting passages from the bible distorting it in any way? You do nothing but post drivel which makes no factual statements at all. And you call that debating? "
notsarc,32,"correct, of all the freedoms most dear is the right to be left to **** alone."
notsarc,33,"and that dear freedom is the beauty of the human imagination. one day someone may stumble upon the answer, and their not going to do it being home schooled, as your donation society would only allow for."
notsarc,34,i agree with you dear... good reply of question... :)
notsarc,35,he was in indonesia dear. read his xxxx (my marks) i thought he was as old as the devil??
notsarc,36,"dear easyride, although i grew up in annapolis, i never went into the military. the rank of captain is maritime. currently, i run a tourboat in miami. while not strictly a battle field, we see plenty of action. thanks for the help. dear greg, although i would love to cruise through the boards to learn why people become creationists; i don't have the time. i have this poll posted at nearly a dozen other sites and counting.  the demographic information, as well as why, is an attempt to find a statistical thread running through the creationist community."
notsarc,37,oh dear lord...the onion is why i wake up in the mornings. they're talking about making it a pay site though. my world would just crumble.
notsarc,38,"again, you speak as if gays and lesbians are not worthy of their relationships being sacred to them. as if gays and lesbians are unable to hold dear any concept of commitment, loyalty, partnership.  what a sad and mean little man you are."
notsarc,39,"[quote=matthew s]xxxxx as folk all the way. too bad it has ended :( i loved the show boston common when it was on. quote] qaf was awsome. the l word is good too, but it seems to have a high turnover in it's cast. boston common was wonderful. the guy from yes, dear is in it and he is so funny."
notsarc,40,"ez, can you cite an actual case where the aclu has intervened on behalf of nambla? the only person or persons with close associations to nambla that i can bring to mind is the notorious father paul r. shanley who molested countless children and was carefully sheltered under the wing of the notorious his eminence bernard francis cardinal law who was finally ousted from his cardinalship by a multitude of angry roman catholic parishioners in the boston area. dear his eminence bernard francis cardinal law was immediately taken and sheltered under the wing of the vatican and scooted over the pond to several administrative posts of the roman curia, where he was also named as archpriest of the basilica di santa maria maggiore, one of the five major basilicas of the roman catholic church."
notsarc,41,"i'm in total agreement with that statement. unfortunately, parents are passing that mindset on to their children. the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005, which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation, at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering. we'll end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance.  on the bright side, we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry, the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills."
notsarc,42,"dear lisa, i want to tell you you're hot. hot as in every way possible. in fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. the way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: if you'll remove that top button i would have enough nerve to"
notsarc,43,"that's not because of something i did. that's because of something that happened back in the 1950s, i believe. that's fine--go ahead and be offensive! it will only hamper your efforts because it only makes people angry at you when you belittle things they hold dear. but what about religious people that aren't out to do that to you and your family? if the govt. endorses a religion, remove the endorsement! that's fine. you're still willing to be offensive to all religious people because of fundamentalists (which are really the ones doing what you describe!). you can be as offensive and show as much lack of respect as you want. it's only going to make it harder on you to convince people."
notsarc,44,"hello there, my dear fellow, you're using a 19th century definition for a 21st century subject. it doesn't work. what you're writing is pure drivel. there is the caucasian group which you initially mention, then you misuse the terminology, actually meaning the sub-ethnicities of the caucasians. no doubt you're one of those sadly misinformed individuals who believes that 'muslim' is a race. the state of education is surely at an all time low-and getting lower no doubt. cheers from the rockies emoticonxkill emoticonxhoho emoticonxcry emoticonxkill"
notsarc,45,"archie, dear, most of those who promote dominionism want to return to the laws of the old testament. the same rules that found eating shellfish to be an abomination. to learn more, you can read this: http://www.chalcedon.edu/ebook/godsplanforvictory.pdf"
notsarc,46,"my dear; sweetie; (and any other ridiculous and intentionally patronizing words you regularly use) i don't support the gop. i think both parties are corrupt. you on the other hand, seem to have sold your soul to the dnc a long time ago."
notsarc,47,"100% because it's programmed to do that. note that when you pick a color for your number, you have narrowed the programs choices to five. note the groupings of the like colored numbers and you will see that when you get ready to pick your house that each of the numbers in your color range has been placed in a different house. (this applies to all color groupings. they've also added numbers 26 thru 30 which do not appear in the original array.) when you pick your house (if your honest about it) the program knows your number. it then displays that number behind the first door that you click on, regardless of which one of the three doors you choose. elementary, my dear watson! some people just hate to see christians having fun?"

notsarc,51,and i strongly dispute that albert einstein was a bundle of emotions too. who says he didn't have emotions?? it is just that he is not a bundle of it. and also i think music is a bundle of emotions and not man. because music generates emotions and it is not wrong that dear mr. alberto was a music lover but that doesn't mean he is a bundle of emotions!!!!!!!!!!

notsarc,54,"our world is entering a new zenith of intelligence. and technology has brought us thus far. from the humble wheel to the advanced smartphones, technology is at our side as we grow into ever intelligent creatures. laziness is not induced by technology, my dear opponents, there is no technology that can change your attitude to anything. there are those that use technology to the fullest, there are those who become couch potatoes. but technology's impact on our race and our civilisation is impossible to neglect. you owe this opportunity of coming online and debating solely to technology and the advent of the internet, technology defending champion."
notsarc,55,"the rights of the collective must not take away the rights of the individual. how would you like your private choices to be dictated by other people? freedom is a right, even for you. i would defend to the death your right do whatever as long as you don't violate other people's rights, and i want the same in return. if we take away individual liberty, society as a whole dies away because the individual has no voice, no recourse, no means of obtaining freedom, and that my dear is not the type of society that i am willing to live in. all due respect to you of course."
notsarc,56,"firstly, my dear opponent is not well informed. because all public houses have there medical workers. and if there 'worker' is infected they do not let him work at their public house and that checking is held twice a month. so that's infecting is impossible. never the less honor is the most important thing for girls in kazakh families. ans having such kind of relations for her is unforgivable i think. i think that all people do not satisfied in lower salary. and kazakh people will want to take higher places in their working place. and have career growth. and so they may as managers and gain skills by them self while people from africa will do all 'dirty' work."

notsarc,90,"the 2012 ndaa reiterated the nuaf document from 2001 and also later stated that it must abide the constitution, so it's nothing new. one thing obama, bush, and all other presidents have and will do, is start shit with other countries. yeah it sucks but it's beyond our control, literally and practically. the guy is the commander-in-chief, thereby a war mongering assmite, but nevertheless, his social policies are fantastic. lgbt rights and gay rights, women's rights, i'm down for that. the increase in debt, yeah it's his fault, but whatthefuck would you do? there's no money to be had, and in order to still function, the u.s. needs money. i believe we were beyond the debt horizon years ago, in that we basically have been bought wholesale by china, and this debt is just their mortgage."
notsarc,91,"that's fantastic! i say you go for it, and... um... pics or it didn't happen."
notsarc,92,"yeah, that was all just exaggeration and absurdities from religionist to make the story more fantastic and supernatural. or else nobody will ever join them religion."
notsarc,93,"we do! on npr (which is our national public radio) they play the bbc world news daily. it is a fantastic source, i must agree."
notsarc,94,"jcampbe there is no political or economical theory that supports your assertions. you are putting together wild speculations combined with fantastical day dreams and calling it a guarantee. it won't work because you can't control costs, you can't recruit personnel and no government can sustain the system."
notsarc,95,"i feel the opposite is true. i feel a lack of hierarchy adds complication to the layout. it's pretty functional don't get me wrong. freaking cool site, but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color (brand = two colors, blue/orange, arguments has 2 choices...). they even dabbled in it a little with the 'add argument' buttons above. the grid structure of the layout seems mildly confusing as well. for instance, the vertical alignments of usernames with their respective arguments could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity. or if the leading (space between lines of text) wasn't so consistent, each 'argument' might be better framed visually, without the addition of graphics or color. obviously, this is not gospel or some fantastic soultion, i just think lack of color could be one of a few ideas on improving clarity and functionality of the site."
notsarc,96,"good sir, doctor who has always been amazing. same with sherlock; it's a fantastic show, and cumberbatch is great playing as holmes."
notsarc,97,"thewayitis, i would say is one of the best debaters on here. he argues his points well, and doesn't relent.  his default picture matches his personality. a wise old man who knows exactly what he's talking about. i would absolutely like to dispute you. thewayitis is a fantastic debater, one whom i respect and often agree with."
notsarc,98,"100x better? that's a lot. it doesn't bother me that dalai lama is human. people love gandhi, and that guy let his wife die because he didn't believe in medicine. then a few days later when gandhi ended up getting sick with the same illness, he accepted the medicine. so he was a bit of a dick, but he was also a little bit brilliant. both the dalai lama and gandhi teach some fantastic messages, and even though they aren't perfect themselves, that doesn't mean some of their messages aren't worthwhile."
notsarc,99,"why not invite a bunch of famous people? de niro is an incredibly interesting guy; my brother used to work on many films with him as a lighting specialist. he was one of the few folks that actually got to know him. scorsese, on the other hand, i'm sure, like you said, has tons of stories and anecdotes, all of which i'd love to hear! i've got my fair share of intellectual, spiritually magnificent people: ghandi, nietzsche and morello are all fantastic people."
notsarc,100,"i would suggest trying out new activities/hobbies she might enjoy. at her age, gymnastics is a fantastic activity, which gets her comfortable with moving her body in different ways and would set her up for a healthy, active lifestyle later on. dance is also fun for children at her age. above all, if she's not already part of one, i would suggest putting her in a preschool program (not a daycare) so she can be around other children her age and learn the fundamentals that will set her up for academic success."
notsarc,101,"this is true but maybe i have add when it comes to reading about something i already know, the book has always been better than the movie to me if i see the movie prior to the book it upsets me already. what i hate the most and i mean absolutely despise is when i see a fantastic movie that is based off of a book. if i haven't read the book i feel like slapping myself in the face for not doing so! to me i just am unable ( really ) to read the book when i know what happens in visual detail ="",20,that's interesting because you are certain to miss something that may just intrigue you in reading the book. a movie is rarely absolute but the book always is.  3_38125,5,fantastic,oh so true. not funny. not to me anyway. it was put together well"
notsarc,102,"...i usually go to the one on morena. and heres why i'm telling you: it's a big ass world out there and you don't know what i look like. also, it's a fantastic costco and i'm proud to shop there."
notsarc,103,"yes they both rock,but the main things is what you're looking for. if your looking for romance,emotion,etc, that type then ya the twilight saga books are great. on the other hand,if you want to enter a world of fantisy,magic,action,etc,then the harry potter series kills anything. the movies of these two are good but not nearly as fantastic as their books. :)"

notsarc,105,"So according to one of the people who conducted the study don't go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion.One woman I know had an abortion a short time after she was married. I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much. So we cannot simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can. "
notsarc,106,"This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative. It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar. And of course, even if the Geologic column is not true, this provides no evidence of creationism. "
notsarc,107,"fine. thank you.  what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus. how do you define the moral consensus? in attilas case, would that be among the huns? among the hun ruling elite? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he (for the sake of argument) has no intimate knowledge?  now why should he act in accordance with the consensus?  this is not completely clear to me. so, do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned?"
notsarc,108,"lol, what did you mean by that? i'm not sure, and dont want to assume the tone you infer with. i thought it was funny but wanted to clarify. ps; i have never called anyone a 'fetus worshiper', although at least that label does not elicit the same evil connotations 'pr-abortion does'. @ simone, no worries hun :)"
notsarc,109,"hun dont let no ones opinions bother you. no one matters but you, because your living your life and its your body. i personally think everyone shold hold off till 16 but im not going to insult you because thats just plain retarded. what gives you people the right to insult someone for asking a question? im not talking about freedom of speech im talking about being a nice person. nobody has manners anymore, i swear."
notsarc,110,"i recommend that gay people stay out of and move out of the state of virginia. thanks to pat the nazi robertson and jerry the hun falwel virginia has become the most hostile in the country towards gay and lesbians. no contract, including wills, powers or attorney, and even the joint purchase of a house, may be made by people of the same sex. this is one of the most evil laws that has been passed and will be used against the surviving spouses of gay people by evil christianist realetives to invalidate wills and powers of attorney's for god's sake stay out of the evil state of virginia"
notsarc,111,"please direct me to this quote. i have his book, the reformation, and he makes it quite clear the numbers are at 2-3 thousand, though some people in the 1700's said it was over 100 thousand, which was impossible. you seem a bit ignorant about the church, let alone the encyclopedia approved by it. the church has a long history of keeping very detailed and very accurate articles. to say that the church's approval is not worth anything is to say attila the hun never went to rome (or italy), that charlamange never existed, and that many of the popes didn't exist.  the savage europeans wern't conquering the americas, so they didn't need to be civilized, as i've already made quite clear. the savage europeans were people like the vikings, not people like the english or french."
notsarc,112,"i am not arguing that business decreases, i am saying that it is not as bad as you make it sound. i'm a bit surprised... you would prefer those small businesses to companies that give billions of dollars to charities?"
notsarc,113,xd i wouldn't be surprised. i'm actually surprised that the kkk are still allowed to remain active. that's one the downsides to freedom of speech i guess.
notsarc,114,"i'm a little surprised by this. the polls i've seen show that mass voters favor gay marriage. i would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial. then again, seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started, i can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them. not the most couragous stance, but perhaps safer in the long run. you are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem."
notsarc,115,"i'm a little surprised- i've found that pot smokers are usually the least pushy. usually they're laid back enough to just offer, unless they forget to offer. i've only ever been pressured to drink by one person, and that's all the peer pressure i've received. i'm not sure if it's the people i hang with, who almost all use something but are very laid back, or if it's that i'd be hard to ressure so that people don't try. what's your experience been?"
notsarc,116,i'm always amazed at how women can do stuff with their bodies that make my body react ;)
notsarc,117,"great choice. you may remember her from the beethoven movies, she played the mother in part 3. i've seen that film at least a dozen times and i like it more with each viewing.  yeah i know what you mean, but i can't help watching sometimes,lol.. i treat it like taking a trip to the candy store, i'm always surprised at how much research some of these atheists will do to debunk god..."
notsarc,118,"i'm always surprised by these numbers. i mean, i know we live in countries with distinct christian majorities, but nonetheless, the high numbers in these polls always catch me a little off guard. it would seem to me that there is a larger population of non-christians, as well as those who fall into the atheist/agnostic camp, than these polls generally present. i guess i could be completely wrong though. i think it's in part due to the much lower profile of religion in canada, though i suspect the numbers would be fairly similar here. waxy"

notsarc,120,"well that's just wrong. the un partition plan was based on the idea of a two state solution. yes, the palestinians disagreed, but it was never the jewish peoples decision to make, to take what was given to the palestinians. the result - israel captured the other 50% land which was allotted to the arabs as per the partition plan. fair result in a war. if you believe israel's best claim to the land is when it took it from the arabs, i'm amazed that you're still defending it."
notsarc,121,"homework should take as long as needs to, also how do you have 9 hours school btw? and putting in 4 hours is impressive, assuming you don't have someone with a cat o' nine tails standing behind your chair. when i was your age i went absolutely insane, i'm amazed you can maintain such discipline."
notsarc,122,"yeah! its a benefit to be able to do a thing like that. i'm amazed that we've come so far in technology and science, but i think there is a line of what we can offer people. its not like they're gonna chose whether they want to have an egg or a bagel for breakfast."
notsarc,123,"wow ursus, uh, hmm, it's like i'm amazed but almost not surprised to hear that. i think it explains a lot. i wish and hope that they will realize that most non-religious people are rational, good-natured, well-adjusted folks that mostly want everyone to get along. (insert campfire song here) and that a lot of them fear a theistic government that limits freedom."
notsarc,124,heh. i'm amused that we both put 'massage' in quotes.
notsarc,125,"you know, i'm astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland  this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-semitism, racism, hatred to moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against hiv-positive persons. this fact was evinced in poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by us department bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor. here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. to put it short, there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution  jews, non-europeans (arabs, moslems, africans, roma), persons of alternative sexuality and hiv-positive persons."
notsarc,126,"i'm nothing if not a thoughtful atheist, but it's not skepticism that drove me from religion, but revulsion, and i absolutely refuse to let fear, the lowest of emotions and religions favorite trump card, to have any sway over my life when it comes to determining my religious beliefs. fear of judgement day is just one more trick religion has to get us to submit, and while i'm not surprised it worked to control illiterate savages and barbarians thousands of years past, i'm astounded so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascals wager."
notsarc,127,"why do you seem to have such an bone to pick with capitalism? it would be different if there were a proven superior system out there, but there isn't. capitalism isn't perfect, but it's the best we really have without giving way too much power to government. but i'm even more fascinated at how you tie religion to government policy like socialism or capitalism. i find that a rather strange mindset. i tend to think of religion an more of an individual thing rather than something to fuel government programs. a comment on capitalism doesn't really even belong in a discussion on satanism."
notsarc,128,"i'm not making fun of you lol i'm honestly amazed at how different people can be though the same age.  and srom, it's the internet. don't take anything you read off the internet seriously. and have you realized that maybe it's you that's the problem? i mean not the problem, but causing it. you may want to refine your debating techniques if you want respect on this site."
notsarc,129,"im not by any means generalising about men and women at all. but i'm honestly surprised that you have never met people that think this way. i personally know lots of people that pride themselves of being a 'player'. how could you not be aware of this? as for women, the majority of women i've come into contact with are seeking long-term to permanent relationships. often they find themselves being 'played' by guys who are after just one thing, and they sometimes are unfortunate to end up a single mother, while the dad continues to be a 'rolling stone' as for ideals, what i describe is no ideal by any stretch of the imagination. men that pursue women just for a one-night-stand are everywhere. im still baffled that you think i'm making this up"
notsarc,130,"this has nothing to do with my post. you don't need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy. i'm an advocate of science, and even i admit that, especially at the quantum level, shit gets crazy. particles being in two places at once, 95% of the universe being undetectable, whole separate universes colliding to make new ones. it's crazy yes, but it is also scientific. in fact, compared to science, the answers psychics provide are rather boring. i'm impressed by the stuff i just listed, not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog."
notsarc,131,"oh, good! but on a side note, keep up the new generation of education. your students are lucky, this in my opinion is the best was to truly learn and grasp an idea. i'm impressed that you took a step beyond the text book. keep up the good work!"

notsarc,133,"i noticed..., you got a public apology. i'm impressed ;)"
notsarc,134,"i'm not disputing the numbers, and i'm certainly not disputing the fact that bush won.  what i'm intrigued about is the razor thin margins, to my mind anyway, that characterize the us election system. don't you find it the least bit odd that it's been 30 years since a president received a plurality? waxy"
notsarc,135,"if i may hijack this thread (sad to do so as i love seeing people criticise bush), i'm intrigued by this idea that deindustrialisation is a bad idea. if it is, then most of the world is doomed to live in povety surely? there is only a finite manufacturing capacity within the word and it is far less than the total number of jobs required throughout the world. we have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs. are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term?"
notsarc,136,"i'm intrigued by that last tidbit there, infant baptism. can you please substantiate that with some scriptures?"
notsarc,137,"alright, i think i see your point know. however, i think the only way in which conservatives would be socialist is that they're soo capitalist they end up effectively swinging back to the other end of the spectrum by making people want to kill them. which is a silly argument because the proletariat ain't never rose up and not settled for simple tax breaks or what have you. furthermore, i'm intrigued by your fascism point, i'm just wondering how it affects the debate. are you saying that essentially all political ideals can effectively be reduced to the same ideology at their basest level?"
notsarc,138,"i'm intrigued, can you give one or two examples off of the top of your head?  good point as to the 2nd paragraph."
notsarc,139,"sorry dude, these links are either vague or irrelevant to the topic, the abstract to the phd thesis is on the guy's own website and doesn't give a link to the actual work. i'm not stating this doesn't happen, i'm just intrigued by the possibility and i don't buy into anything unless i can see some verified, hopefully peer-reviewed work, any search on google for these names doesn't give anything of value."
notsarc,140,"ya it's true, it was pretty hilarious. i'm just surprised he only got 7 days and a $1,000 fine. it is only single a minor leagues, but that was rediculous."
notsarc,141,"proof? and, i'm just surprised that brooks is actually capable of seeing where the problem lies. his solution? probably another dumb republican non-solution."
notsarc,142,"i'm kind of amused by the idea that the king james version is the most accurate, there are a lot of fairly well documented flaws, like the introduction of unicorns into the old testament. you also seem to imply that modern translations were dreamed up by a couple of drunken biblical scholars with nothing better to do on a friday evening, whereas most are at least as rigorously researched as the kjv, and often with a greater number of sources available."
notsarc,143,"i'm not talking about talk radio, i'm talking about rctv, the venezuelan station that had its licence withdrawn. i'm saying that if a us station were advocating the violent overthrow of the government, as rctv did, then it would lose its licence in a flash, not the 5 years the venezuelan government put up with it. i'm kind of amused by the idea of hillary clinton being a socialist though..."
notsarc,144,"to be honest with you, i'm mildly amused at best."
notsarc,145,"inasmuch as the idea of substantive due process is a contradiction in terms, i'm not all that surprised that it's history is quite complicated. the idea of substantive due process was indeed invented by judges, which just goes to show one thing: if it needed to be invented after the constitution was ratified, it wasn't part of the constitution to begin with. in other words, because the idea of substantive due process was not contemplated by the framers or ratifiers of the constitution, it is not a legitimate doctrine."
notsarc,146,"the argument has nothing to do with whether the bible is true or not, and everything to do with how certain concepts and interpretations are deduced from reading a piece of literature. i'm not arguing that i believe in a rapture, but rather that there is biblical support for a rapture event. i hope you see the difference"
notsarc,147,"the catholic position on evolution always seemed to me a rather supine cop-out, and i'm not at all surprised that some catholics are re-examining it. cardinal schonborn in his nyt article wrote schonborn has a fearsome reputation as an intellectual, but his demand that any scientific treatment of evolutionary theory has to start with an a priori assumption of design does not say a lot for his understanding of science."
notsarc,148,"i'm not enthralled to go to school. i really don't enjoy the experience. i do, though, know that it would be better for me and everyone else that goes to school. we can't depend on our country just being good, we have to actually do something to make it that way. education is the easiest way to do that. and, just for the record, i do go to summer school. where i live, summer school is only two periods per day, and i can only take certain classes. it really sucks. but, we have to look at the big picture. i don't like many of my classes, and i don't like many of my teachers. but i'm not going to sacrifice my education for comfort or the ability to relax, at least not in high school.  think about it. i'm sure you'd agree."
notsarc,149,"no they can't. their gods are the god of this world, and his name is satan. that's the problem with cults, they deceive and lead to death, not life. but i'll agree that the darkness has spiritual power, but nothing good can come of it. you know what's sad ? i'm not even surprised you would list wiccan as a valid religion that actually represents life and goodness."
notsarc,150,i completely agree. this school's decision is ridiculous to say the least but the sad part is that i'm not even surprised by this. this sort of thing seems to be happening more and more lately.
notsarc,151,"would you consider yourself philosophical? no, i don't think philosophy is useful. everything they claim that cannot be supported by science is simple word games, like the ontological argument. lolzor is the first person i have discussed philosophy with ever, and i'm not impressed with philosophy's lack of demonstrative capabilities."
notsarc,152,"the 9/11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report. the 9/11 commission omitted it because...??? what is this deep dark secret they don't want the american public to know? which, according to you is easily figured out anyway.

notsarc,154,"i'm not in the least surprised.. i stated that it was required by law.. i never said anything about when it became a requirement. as of now, in the year 2010 applying for a ss number is required.. would you say that is an invasion of privacy?..  and for your information clinton wasn't the first or last president to rape the social security program.. politicians have been using it as a personal bank for decades."
notsarc,155,"not that i was interested in joining them, but i did read the two links. i'm not much surprised that science has nothing to do with it...and not at all surprised that many actors are into it...hollywood has long been known to generate kooks. i suppose they are just a small portion of the total, but they are very publicized."
notsarc,156,"i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management."
notsarc,157,"while i can't say i'm a history buff, i'm not shocked about all that either. perhaps it's because i'm mostly a misanthropist."
notsarc,158,"as compared to how they would be during a period of instability? i said they were internally stable so we agree here, ahem. also the us is not unstable as far as external physical forces are to us. economic forces you could make a point but not the extent that everyone is declaring sanctions against us. that is what north korea is basically doing only it is a physical force that is building against them. the us has no external threat against them at this time that is as threatening as what north korea is facing and that is because the us is far more externally stable than north korea is. i'm not surprised that you declare the us evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on."

notsarc,160,that makes sense since howard would not answer whether jesus is god or not. good catch! most attacks on true christianity center around who jesus is and whether or not the bible is the word of god. so i'm not surprised that's what we're dealing with. jesus is god!

notsarc,163,that's ...... well i'm not surprised really. have you ever watched 2 1/2 men? it's content is all about charlie's character's sex life.
notsarc,164,"i thought the book was one of the most boring pieces of fiction i've ever read. i didn't finish it.  i'm not surprised that the movie version is a point of controversy. christians don't take well to versions of their belief system that question dogma, even those vehicles intended as general entertainment."
notsarc,165,"no one believes this. this is a non-issue. i'm not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu. you don't take these issues seriously at all. thus you can have a good laugh, and be sarcastic and think you are witty. in reality, it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues. 'the equality-obsessed modern gay pride movement'? gays don't have equality, and therefore there is a movement for that. i don't think anyone is obsessed with equality. i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status."

notsarc,169,"you'd be surprised. i'm sure something else will come up in the future that makes bs's nationalization seem quaint. still, it is pretty horrific what the fed did to the public. nationalization of debt while almost giving away revenue generating assets. seriously.  what is disturbing is that the american public just sat there while their government saddled them with additional debt that has no rational future revenues. but given the peanut gallery here, i'm not surprised the rest of the nation is as ignorant.  but as i spoke to symbiote, the next crisis will be much worse. we haven't solved ****. it's a poor quality band-aid, if that."

notsarc,171,"i think that's an excellent question. since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology, i can only speculate that it's a combination of peer pressure, the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings.  there have been several instances in which members of the ipcc have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did not reflect their research. since the final ipcc reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published, i'm not surprised with the claims made. here's a relevent story. "
notsarc,172,"thanks for that, jason. in esdraelon's defense, there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context, and morph them into something that looks like what he described. (a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression."
notsarc,173,"i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught."
notsarc,174,"that's interesting, because all of the things the bible apparently says about them is left to be intentionally vague and unanswered. for example - 'the bible, however, makes it plain that dinosaurs and people must have lived together. actually, as we will soon see, there is a lot of evidence for this.' great. now, where in the bible does it say this? because science has disproven that dinosaurs and humans lived together through carbon dating. that's a fact. the link you gave me cites zero scientific evidence, only incredibly far stretches of what the bible says. so, you've given me no proof. i'm not surprised."
notsarc,175,"he'll get to you eventually, he's doing them in order of points. lol though i'm disappointed to say that a lot of people, including myself, are starting to lose interest in the roasts. i'm not surprised though, because there's a lot of inactive users."
notsarc,176,"brooke got the boot! i'm not surprised, her performances last night were weak."
notsarc,177,"finally an other conservative in this site. i mean who do these people think they are? trying to pass amendments like the fairness act. but i'm not surprised that some order is coming back to are leaders. when the government swings to far to one side, (in this case left) its ganna swing back to the other side, we just as conservatives, need to make sure we don't go to right, or we'll have done just as bad as the liberals."
notsarc,178,looks like you're right. the movie scored #1 this weekend earning some $23 million. i guess i'm not too surprised since the johnny depp talk seems to have cooled down already.
notsarc,179,"i do agree. the rot started here when thatcher came to power, and became chronic when neil kinnock became leader of the labour party. now we have two parties in hock to corporate interests, and even if another party did get elected, their hands are tied because of the reaction of the financial markets. the actions of the ecb in bailing out hedge funds is a sign of how bad it has got. i think we'd best not discuss the solution otherwise we'll start to disagree again. :p george monbiot has the beginnings of a plan in his book age of consent. i'm quite surprised you agree with what is an essentially marxist analysis of the situation though."
notsarc,180,pretty damn disgusting. i'm quite surprised that you've never heard of it. i didn't think that it was still all that novel.
notsarc,181,"it depends on who's determining that it 'is not favorable'. it can be biased if the judge of it is biased.  a round earth is something we can observe in the here and now. i'm really surprised the 'flat earth' label is still tossed around by evolutionists today. it was used by evolutionists as early as the nineteenth century as a method of ridiculing christians. the fact is, most belief in a flat earth disappeared by the fifteenth century. the fact that evolutionists still use it is an indicator of the insecurity they have in themselves.  likewise, evolutionists have squat for origins, for the simplest forms of life. you'd think that after spending billions evolutionists would be able to come up with something for a foundation for their beliefs. but no - not one."
notsarc,182,"really??! it's stated, very clearly in the creeds. i'm somewhat surprised by this."
notsarc,183,"...and half right. preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox. your logic is severely flawed here. i'm somewhat surprised by that. if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that, i still predicted it. i was just wrong. you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future. he made some lucky guesses...that's all. sometimes, the local fortune cookies are right, too. sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit. that doesn't mean that the writer's actually knew anything about their future readers."
notsarc,184,"you know full well that isn't what i said at all. i was pointing out the difference between dogma and church teaching. for the most part, as much as i ususally disagree with you, you are quite reasonable and know your facts before entering into a discussion. that's why i'm so surprised at you here. so what? there are hundreds of laws out there on the books that don't actually get enforced anymore. old hangers-on from a 150 years ago taht never got changed. just because it technically could happen doesn't mean it is relevant anymore."
notsarc,185,the aruba case fuelled a lot of bad blood around here. to be honest i'm still astonished about the whole thing. what idiot starts verbally assaulting wartime allies over a missing person's case?
notsarc,186,"yea - i'm still fascinated by the stories i'm told about wakan-tanka (great spirit), winter man, coyote, and other beliefs of the lakhota people. i wish i had the time to learn more of their traditions and beliefs. i could literally sit and listen for hours. unfortunately, i was just passing through the dakotas (town called bullhead or bull head?) and had to leave. i needed one of their of sweat lodge treatments at the time  real bad:)"
notsarc,187,i'm surprised no one has mentioned this guy before now: http://epedia.pbworks.com/f/platypusc-2.jpeg
notsarc,188,really?? i'm surprised you would want it to be true.
notsarc,189,"jim and ghost, i think you both missed my point. my fault, i should have been more clear. total disarmament was never my intention.  my point was, what kind of military might do you think it would take to pacify loosely organized militias of americans fighting an islamic occupier? at what cost? do you think they could ever completely subdue the insurgent force?  i don't, because i know i'd rather die than live under a regime that was everything i despised. when you're fighting for your way of life, your religion, or even your perceived freedom, continued motivation will never be a problem. you could take all the guns out of iraq, the insurgents would be throwing rocks at the american soldiers and each other. waxy ps - i must say i'm surprised at both of your stances on the 2nd amendment, i agree with you jim."
notsarc,190,"with the way things are going for all the networks, jim, i'm surprised he's lasted as long as he did. his methods were deemed obsolete even before all the controversy. but, i like him. at least he's going out in style - march, i believe - the anniversary (40th ??) when he took over for walter. too bad one bobble got him thrown into the dungeon."
notsarc,191,"though bush, in this case, was quoting abraham lincoln, i'm surprised not to have seen any comments regarding his references to god. especially in... 'those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just god, cannot long retain it.'"
notsarc,192,i'm surprised that they still have that on their website after bellesiles was proven to be a fraud. what do you mean by the dates?
notsarc,193,"that's pretty funny, the last two posts that is. that's actually interesting that the term started that way. i'm surprised that no one had coined a term before that though."
notsarc,194,the cinemas here have the similar ads prior to the movie. they also include one about talking during the movie. i'm surprised at how rude people are at the theater nowadays. emoticonxmad
notsarc,195,"i was awake, just not on at the time you posted this. high school starts waaaayyy to early. anyway, i'm surprised at how many people post while i'm asleep (around 11:30 - 5:30 est)"
notsarc,196,"i'm surprised that 'the sixth sense' didn't make anyone's list. the twist at the end totally caught me off guard and blew me away. i also like forest gump, slingblade, platoon, top gun, the wizard of oz, shawshank redemption. there are more but it's monday.... :p"
notsarc,197,"i'm surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam's government or (prior to us occupation resistance) al qaeda. his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory, where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion, and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden. zarqawi's bio has been reviewed on the internet many, many times: http://www.weeklystandard.com/conten...4/094npvzg.asp as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia, they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them. even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds didn't want something, it wouldn't be there. and need i mention pakistan? http://www.wtnh.com/global/story.asp?s=1381324 http://www.nationalreview.com/commen...0402090859.asp"
notsarc,198,"i'm surprised that some people still aren't aware of what the chinese have done to upgrade their country. sure, certain areas like the financial sector are still lagging (which is why they won't float the yuan just yet), but when it comes to industry and infrastructure they're done a most admirable job. does anybody here also think it's kinda funny that a communist country is beating the us at their own game (i.e. capitalism)?"
notsarc,199,"@ raastee: i've glanced through your paper: i'm surprised you were allowed to get away with the sentence, 'irrationalism is a fallacy to be avoided'. irrationalism is not a fallacy: a fallacy is an apparently genuine but really an illogical argument. irrationalism, outside number theory, is merely a discourse or statement inconsistent with the use of reason."
notsarc,200,"reminds me of the cold war clamor of necessary 'defense' nuclear weapon parity with russia. considering the threats we make directed towards iran and others along with our occupation of iraq, i'm surprised our conceit hasn't made all of me and asia scramble for nukes. pakistan, 97% muslim, hides bin laden, governed by a general constantly avoiding assassination attempts, never a bad word about that us 'ally'. but they have nukes and delivery systems. i'd think iran believes, as we've shown, that the us doesn't spew the democracy at the point of a gun policy to those nations possessing nuclear weapons."
notsarc,201,"israel promises war if iran is allowed to develop nuclear weapons. that israel already has them is, of course, fine with the us. that pakistan, not exactly a pillar of stability, has them is not an issue. after what the us did to iraq i'm surprised every me country doesn't want nukes. but we'll continue the game on israel's terms and all cope with suicide bombers."
notsarc,202,"having been raised in texas as a child and teen, with many relatives still residing there, i'm surprised their educational system hasn't gone to the bible as its primary textbook. perhaps things have changed, but fundamentalist hypocrisy was at one time the law of the land in texas. maybe since texans are no longer served by oklahoma and louisiana bootleggers the fire and brimstone circuit has relaxed, but i'd find that difficult to believe as religion is a very effective control technique."
notsarc,203,"i think this is something everyone on here can get behind. at least i would hope so. saying that fred phelps is an embarrassment to this nation and my home state would be a gross understatement. sadly, i can't say i'm surprised by this, but i definitely don't think i would have ever predicted it. what he is doing is despicable. and what the patriot guard is doing is amazing. i like the sentiment involved in attempting to pass laws against protesting at funerals (although i don't know if they'll hold up in court), i only wish they had felt the same when he was protesting aids victims."
notsarc,204,"living in kansas myself, i'm surprised i haven't heard more about this. when this came up in missouri a few years ago, it was a huge deal."
notsarc,205,it's challenging enough for parents to fly with infants or children. i'm surprised a mother with children would complain. i'd think she'd have enough on her hands during the ride herself.  maybe she had hired help along. she certainly couldn't have been too busy with her own children. and she certainly must have been seated far from their seats and sounds. as a crying infant in front or back of her children was not her concern.
notsarc,206,"i'm surprised no one has mentioned the incident in burlington, vt. if you read the first story on that, you'll find out that women have the right to breast feed their baby anywhere the baby is allowed to be. while i would not be 100% comfortable with it, i recognize that if a mother chooses to breast feed her baby, she needs to be able to feed it when it's hungry, whether it be on a plane, in a car (not driving) or in a restaurant."
notsarc,207,"it's a pretty obvious counter question, i'm surprised it caught him so off guard. what's his name, if you don't mind my asking? i've got friends in illinois who would appreciate knowing about this, if they're in his district."
notsarc,208,"i agree. hence why we need to evict the gop from the congress today it is evident by the liberal history of the gop majority that they cannot be trusted with money, with the size of government, with foreign relations, with underage pages, with the military in general, with privacy, civil rights or even the most basic function of congress: oversight.  liberalism needs to be evicted from congress, therefore the republicans need to go.  it never stopped bothering me that more democrats voted aganist the schavio bill then republicans. democrats more conservative then republicans? well..given how far republicans have gone over i can't say i'm surprised."
notsarc,209,"well, i can't say that i'm surprised. just another politician for ya. they're all the same."
notsarc,210,"allright, well then i think it's odd too, arians would have made more sense. i'm surprised they are considered obscure, the council of nicea is historically considered one of the defining moments of the early christian church, and the arian controvery was it's main event. for the record, they were discussed in my high school, that's why i was making sure."
notsarc,211,"kudos, snakespit. i'm surprised that i'm saying that to you."
notsarc,212,"for someone who puts importance on the ability to think i'm surprised that you believe mentally handicapped people are as valuable as the average person. value is of course the key word here. value can be interpreted to mean many different things including value to the human society. even the humanistic perspective has to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it is only a small portion. i don't think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compared to the avereage 'intelligent and able-bodied humans', wouldn't you agree? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their 'value' to be equal to that of an able-bodied human?"
notsarc,213,"so as to comics/cartoons that have already been mentioned: calvin and hobbes, simpsons, south park, recess, and sponge bob rock my socks off. also pretty much all of adult swim. but i'm surprised no one mentioned this... the fairly odd parents... hella funny ****... oh my god.  that's it for me"
notsarc,214,"this is not good news at all. i'm guessing that there will be a lot of trouble in the near future. one thing that i would not recommend, and i'm surprised that you would even suggest it given your stance on others having an opinion about american elections, is the us getting more involved in there election process. pakistan has to be, and be seen to be, uncompromised in this process. smiley"
notsarc,215,"1st, i never said it was only geography. second .... stats please, regarding your new claim here? so you do think they are inversely proportional. (can't say i'm surprised, it's a view consistent with anti-religious prejudice.) there are plenty of christian scientists with phds that would, i suspect, disagree with you. and i have no idea what your point is on the homeschooling comment. homeschoolers often do better academically."
notsarc,216,"i hope it's obama too, but i will vote for clinton if necessary although i don't really trust her to end the war quickly.  (i must say i'm surprised that there is so little interest in discussing politics on this site given the huge number of comments elsewhere.)"
notsarc,217,"i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it."
notsarc,218,"he was a partial-birth abortion provider that killed babies late term. in terms of fetal viability he might as well been killing babies right after they'd been born. i don't condone it, but i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner--one monster killed by another. it wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better."
notsarc,219,"and a lot of cosmetic surgery. you know, i'm surprised not more comparisons are done with vet care. i had my cat sliced open and a bunch of samples taken and a billion tests and 3-4 nights in the special vet hospital at a vet school. it cost me a fortune! something like $650 bucks. the same procedure which is done in humans (for cancer) costs over $100,000 from what i found out. now you'd expect it to be a lot more but really that much more?"
notsarc,220,"many americans feel that deploying our military in our own cities as a police force sets a bad precedent. i'm surprised you don't. it's one thing to use them in the case of a natural disaster where local police might be overwhelmed, but to open a shooting war with street gangs? chicago ain't rio de janeiro."
notsarc,221,"the reason that halo has been restricted to xbox is because microsoft bought bungie. they want to give people a reason to get a 360. that reason? halo. modern warfare, on the other hand, is owned by neither microsoft or sony. quite frankly i'm surprised that nintendo doesn't own everything already."
notsarc,222,people are destroyed mentally for life and some even kill them selves.due to what happened to them becuase it was so traumatic and most get away with one and do it again some even start killing thier victims so yea .i'm surprised that you are sticking up for rapists
notsarc,223,"1. no, she has a choice, abort or keep and support the child. 2. no, it makes a woman take responsibility for her body, like keeping her legs together. i'm surprised more people aren't in favor of this."
notsarc,224,"i've only had a quick look as i'm on the bus so research is limited but i'm sure the evidence for the 2000 year old israel is biblical, so is the promise from god which is what the modern israel is based on. i thought you thought the bible was stupid bronze age myths for creatards so i'm surprised to see you basing an argument on this. before the modern israel was created the land was part of palestine making it palestinian before it was jewish unless you go by biblical evidence and gods promise."
notsarc,225,"this is some thing we can agree on.  many women think it's a legal right to kill their children with abortion and people like me see it as a crime against humanity.  frankly, i'm surprised there are not even more debates created about it."
notsarc,226,"true, and i'm surprised no one has brought up resources... if there is x amount of a certain resource that we need to survive then when we reach an x amount of people, we could be factually overpopulated although i don't know how any such thing could be measured."
notsarc,227,to be honest i was playing devils advocate i'm surprised more people did'nt comment!!!
notsarc,228,i'm sure i will get bored with the site long before 13000 points. lol! i'm surprised he hasn't.
notsarc,229,"there are tax exemptions for a married couple which a gay person cannot get. that's taxation with unequal representation at the very least. you can't argue the logic of gay marriage, only weird theories of morality. i'm surprised you're attempting this."
notsarc,230,"i support you on these things, however christians are considered warlike as an artifact of the crusades. in which they killed plenty of people (crusades are similar to jihad fyi).  however that idea is outdated. this debate could very easily turn into a useless flamefest like most here on religion. also i'm surprised you didn't use machiavellian in your argument to describe those men. edit: what about iran? the iran-iraq war was clearly a religious war."
notsarc,231,i told you twice. i'm surprised you didn't get the message?
notsarc,232,totally agree. i'm surprised to see how many people think it's funny.
notsarc,233,1. i don't want criminals killed. you have no way of knowing what my wants are and i have never been so arrogant as to tell you what your wants are. 2. you are entitled to be wrong but you aren't entitled to your own facts. children in the womb are just as alive as you are. your denials of that fact not with standing.  3. your reasoning is flawed because you remove the component or aspect of guilt or innocence and substitute wants in p ace of it. your denial of the fact that it (a child in the womb) is alive is a huge red flag on that.  i'm surprised that more pro-aborts don't call you on it.
notsarc,234,"intangible i'm surprised at you from what i've seen your very fair in your debating style, and i understand you don't want to see more suffering, but do you not think there might be a better way ?"
notsarc,235,"i'm surprised that you disagree, seeing as how you've seen the hills have eyes. i'd say hills have eyes was one of the more disturbing films."
notsarc,236,"real version ? (lol, i know what you mean, the original ad is annoying, but i'm surprised only you've noticed this isn't the original)"
notsarc,237,"pro-choice - i agree but first trimester only pro-euthanasia - i agree pro-environmentalism - mmmm? depends pro-gay rights - again... depends pro-immigration ( to an extent) - legal? yes! illegal? no. pro-free healthcare - disagree anti-military action/intervention - mmmm... less, yes but depends anti-globalisation - agree anti-death penalty - disagree pro-stem-cell research - agree pro-gun control - disagree pro-welfare. - disagree pro-marijuana legalisation - agree pro-tobacco illigalisation - disgree i'm surprised you're anti-globalization"
notsarc,238,he has been around with a debate about democracy. i'm surprised you missed!
notsarc,239,i'm surprised i agree with you on this. the only point i'd add is that the force feeding should only be used while the person is undergoing therapy to fix the underlying problems.
notsarc,240,digg/reddit/mixx/propeller/etc what is the difference really? i'm surprised mixx is cd rather than cg.
notsarc,241," i'm surprised. you're saying those are political systems? and that they work well historically?  i'm saying that they operate like political systems, with the leaders of each respective religion issuing edicts that the followers are expected to obey, and often at the penalty of social repercussions if they do not. i measure effectiveness in the ability of the system to survive and spread."
notsarc,242,"no david, soc wouldn't be on a separate part of this site. he proved his mettle time and time again. the problem is becoming constant and i'm surprised you hadn't noticed. since the terrible incidents with repubgal, 14 years of age and involving the abortion/pro-choice debates, i've been able to simply sniff them out...and every time i feel i should look at the profile..bammmmm!!! i'm right with the exception of some that take my breath away because they know so very much at such a young age."
notsarc,243,"well... like i said, considering how many people are sharing earth, i would think we would get a long a lot less than we do. i'm not saying we do get a long very well, but i'm saying i'm surprised we get along as well as we do.. you understand?"
notsarc,244,i'm totally surprised i've posted so many posts in this thread: not like me at all.
notsarc,245,"is it that this has already been discussed a lot elsewhere? if that's the case, let me know. otherwise, i'm very surprised people aren't talking about this. simone? anyone?"
notsarc,246,i'm very surprised to learn that religious institutions are exempt from the normal taxation associated with having employees.
notsarc,247,i also love it when people look at the world reasonably.
notsarc,248,"jitobear, i always love it when you post. you are succinct and to the point and i always wish i had said what you said."
notsarc,249,"this might surprise you but i find you quite impressive as well. despite my criticisms, i am absolutely impressed with how you are able to consider a diversity of views, which, i must say, you are getting a lot better at."
notsarc,250,"honestly, i am amazed, so there are actually gay people with a sense of reason. i have spent years of facing discrimination from narrow minded homosexual activists and all these years later, you are the only one that has ever demonstrated somewhat of a sense of reason beyond the same old hogwash i have seen demonstrated by thousands i have interacted with. i still have my reservations towards suspecting that somehow you might be attempting to set me up for a slam."
notsarc,251,"i am amazed you think al gore is lsong the debate last time i checked he has a global scientific consensus supporting his position, you know that means that the majority of the worlds scientists. http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm "
notsarc,252,"i see why you would think this, and i am amazed by some of the people who have children, but it may be used as population control, and that's not right. i do think that it would be worthwhile to perhaps do evaluations, but people could lie, and corruption could take the entire thing way out of control."
notsarc,253,"again i am astounded by the fact that you think i will endanger children. it is a topic sunset, so why are you calling me demented and sick.  would you agree that everybody in this world is different? everybody thoughts are different. so when someone has different views than your own, you have the nerve to say they are sick.  i know i called you sick. but i said it purposely because you called me sick for foolish reason.  my problem is that i hate it when people call me sick and demented. that is not the person i am and to be hated on this site for my views is completely stupid. i hate the fact that i can't be 'accepted' because of my views."
notsarc,254,"yes its overused a lot but i think the company that needs to take a break and work on things is infinity ward because they don't have as good as games the only game i enjoyed from the cod franchise is mw2 and that was amazing they did a good job on it, but for mw3 all they did was use the same graphics and everything from mw2 except new campaign, spec ops mission, multiplayer weapons and perks and killstreak options but to me they did a horrible job for mw3. they need to stop for 1 year, and come up with ideas to make a better infinity ward game. i am impressed with treyarch and what they did!"
notsarc,255,yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.  wow i have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage. i am impressed.
notsarc,256,"that is a poor argument. if you want to become better at debate, in general, don't make statements you cannot back up, but never say that your using 'what i've been told' as an argument. your opposition will tear you apart. :)  think about a specific statement that you think you can prove through a series of logical arguments regardless of your personal feelings on the subject and invite me to a private debate on it. i am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others i have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure. if you agree, of course."
notsarc,257,"it is not appropriate on this site to call people names. i understand that you are still learning in school and are busy, but i think that they taught basic spelling and grammar at a much early age than 16, so there is really no excuse! i did take the time to google your school, but you are too young to realize that maybe this is not the only coolidge hs in the country... so i went with the first google result... i am not impressed, the school gets a 4 out of 10 and 3 out of 5 stars from parents!"
notsarc,258,i lived in sevilla for the better part of year. spaniards are extremely good at staying out of other people's business. smiling at a stranger on the bus is invasive. i am not surprised most spaniards support gay marriage - most likely because they would never assume it was any of their business.
notsarc,259,"i am overwhelmed watching phelps. he is totally part man part fish. i also think that his attitude shows through, he seems to be highly upbeat and still very focused on the goals which he has set for himself.  jesse owens had his time and place and will never be forgotten. he opened the door for all the wonderful black athletes we see at almost every event at the olympics. but today, right now, phelps is the man."
notsarc,260,"if you want to get rid of them, i know a falconer in your state (iirc you are in texas) who would probably like to come and trap that coopers for you. i keep a red tail and a coopers hawk and he was up not long ago (he keeps a falcon) and we went out quail hunting on horseback. he was extremely impressed with the coopers dash-and-kill ability.  if it was me, i would just sacrifice the few birds that it kills in order to be able to watch the hawks...but then i am partial to raptors."
notsarc,261,"paul.boys, thank you for this little historical footnote. i must add that i am quite shocked to learn of this but not surprised. i think that in now disapproving as a society of child prostitution shows that we have advanced socially--and i argue that it has to do with becoming a more secular society and granting more rights and equality to women and children--as opposed to the almost divinely conferred 'father' right often practiced in old christianity before it was forced to reform by feminism."
notsarc,262,"now, if we're talking natural insemination by donor, that would likely be morally unacceptable in most circles, though certainly not all. really? i mean that sincerely. sometimes i am really surprised by what people find immoral. most people seriously object to that? why? o.o"
notsarc,263,"i don't think i am shocked, i am scared! lol"
notsarc,264,"i am trying to become a going in to college for pre-med and i am shocked at the big decline in competion for such courses. not only has obamas healhcare programs overestimated the capability of our current amount of healthcare providers, but it is also deterring many from seeking such careers. by trying to help everyone in the short term, he is doing more damage to everyone in the long term."
notsarc,265,"no, did you? i don't get why this debate seems to have pissed you off, but it is rather perplexing. i say that everyone deserves human rights; children and adults. am i wrong? i say that privacy is a human right. am i wrong? therefore, privacy is deserved by all human beings; children and adults. am i wrong? get over any issues you may have had, because one person's issues with privacy does not ultimately relate to every other child in the entire world; this is an obvious fact in life and i am shocked that you do not understand this."
notsarc,266,"i think the the p. bagatti is the one that found the burial caves in 1873, not the bagatti who was working in the mid 40's. i have unable to get a copy of the original manuscript the leadership u describes. i think it is only in italian though. i am surprised that such a  'key discovery' from the 19th century is kept so quiet except by claims of an evangilical web site."
notsarc,267,"actually, quite correct. i am surprised. i woudl have thought you more of the relativistic type."
notsarc,268,i am surprised i am going out on a limb saying that i dont think we will find them now. it is possible he dispensed with them to terrorists when we attacked..
notsarc,269,i am surprised people wanted m-80s and stuff like that legal. they accounted for most of the injuries due to fireworks and most of the fires. probably not a smart idea to have them.
notsarc,270,i am surprised a little to see providence college on the list....they are not gay friendly but they do have a gay straigtht alliance and an office of gay studies....i am from providence so i have been there.
notsarc,271,i am surprised that some of the more conservative christians are not weighing in on source of some of the christian terminology and concepts.
notsarc,272,"bassman: i am surprised by most of your recent posts of late. i site this one example above. i am bothered that you posted this rhetoric again. i gave you the statistics and the government websites that support those statistics, that show the millions of people raised from poverty since 1968. from over 22% of the us population in the early 1970s to fewer than 10% in the 1990s, and yet you continue to misinform. you claim to be a christian and mislead just like the scribes and pharisees of jesus day. to purposefully misrepresent the facts is the antithesis of christian behavior and brings into question your very claim to christianity as well as makes suspect your personal agenda which seems much more counterfeit than you would like people to know."
notsarc,273,"my parents moved to shawnee not long ago. when i was a kid, anything west of lenexa was considered too close to desoto, and a little suspect :) i was up that way not long ago, and even deoto is fairly respectable now :) :)  i am surprised there are so many here from kansas. there is somebody here from lenexa as well."
notsarc,274,"i am surprised at your response since i see your posts as well considered and stated. i asked the question and you answered. to me it was clearly, by definition, inflammatory. we can agree to disagree and let readers make their own determination."
notsarc,275,i tend to agree; i am surprised some regulars here seem to intend on even giving this poster the time of day and converse with him after the stuff posted the other night.
notsarc,276,"libertarianism emphasises freedom of the individual, and limited government. a stereotypical libertarian view would be for the legalisation of prostitution. that's why i am surprised."
notsarc,277,"i don't :( tell me, inbox me if you don't want to say it in front of other's.  i am surprised i thought you would be to holy to have lust."
notsarc,278,"as sharp as you are, i am surprised you missed my sarcasm. it happens. we do usually like to stir things up when it interests us. we sell weapons to taiwan and israel.  well then we have nothing to worry about. i didn't say that. we should be concerned by how much money is poured into these black ops programs. i support them, but i am concerned about over spending on them."
notsarc,279,can you believe the stupidity of those who think it acutally is not sex? i am surprised that the two on this board who thinks its not sex won't comment on it. lol
notsarc,280,you are a very good student of buddha. i am very impressed.
notsarc,281,i am very surprised to learn that you make vows before god and hold them sacred.
notsarc,282,"dont begin to understand real love till 18 or older i felt real love when i was 13, and i was with that woman i loved for years. saying someone can't effectively do something until they reach a certain age is ridiculous; turning a certain age doesn't magically make you any wiser nor dumber."
notsarc,283,it was a little hectic when you came in last night but i guess we could do it today in choir if you wanted to.
notsarc,284,lol! well you may have picked the wrong answer choice though??? i guess not much can happen in the desert... maybe a dust storm or something? we get tornadoes here... i was in one as a kid! crazy stuff.
notsarc,285,"sometimes it's fun to play devil's advocate but i guess it's just a people thing. we experience life with these 'rights' and we don't want to give them up, and anyone who brings up an argument against them we shun and flee from."
notsarc,286,i see. i just never came through to see it as worth the buy. i guess i borrow a friends copy.
notsarc,287,"a drink. a drink. one or two. and what the hell does abstinence have to do with this? everything in moderation, yeah yeah. all that fun stuff. i get it. i wasn't talking about light drinking. i guess i should clarify but i thought you'd catch what i meant."
notsarc,288,"that's true i suppose; usually someone makes the plan for them, so i guess i get points for my own initiative, heh"
notsarc,289,"yes if both sides agree to it, as i mentioned in the next sentence, but honestly, how many children do you know or parents that would allow their child to have sex with an adult, as i also said. i guess you never heard of child grooming. no government does not mean no morals or parent leadership. kids are still at the whim of their family. government means enforced morals."
notsarc,290,"i am being real man i guess i got to be more specific answering debates at some points. it's ok to teach your kids the dangers of having sex when they a about 5 since they won't know nothing about it or letting boys or girls taking advantage of them but, far as getting more in dept about it, in my opinion can wait until they are much older."
notsarc,291,"okay, i guess i'll have to watch the new batman movies soon. what did you think of the opening scene to x2? with nightcrawler trying to assassinate the president? one of my favorite scenes from any movie. yeah, each spider-man movie was worse. last i heard, they are planning a complete reboot without tobey or raimi."
notsarc,292,"hmmmm..., unwanted competition...., i guess you are all on that database then ;)"
notsarc,293,just ignore him sometimes this guy is an idiot. i guess atheists will continue questioning everything untill there is no structure.
notsarc,294,"ah, i see. thank you for the clarification. i do not see anything innately bad about that in and of itself, i guess. plenty of 'accident' babies end up having fine lives with responsible parents."
notsarc,295,"you wouldn't be a commodity at all if you weren't willing to sell, you'll be hunted though. i guess you could rent out your labor for a time if you somehow didn't get hunted and weren't willing to sell your genetic material."
notsarc,296,"too right. l. ron hubbard is the closest thing the modern world has to jesus: skeezy, probably un-bathing, secretly greedy but always with a generous front. well, i guess mother theresa would be a close second to l.ron h. xenu."
notsarc,297,"'first off, turn off your damn caps; it only makes you look like a raging troll (which you probably are).' ok i think that i can turn my caps on and off any time i want. but the reason i had caps on that time is becuz i forgot to turn them off  'second, i'm not forty, i'm fifteen. the author of twilight is (believe it or not) almost forty. ' well then i guess i missed something didn't i, and so the rest of my statement does not aply. i am sorry if i offended you in any way but i am so for harry potter movies just becuz every one can act. but i just can't get into the book . too damn big plus i already knew every thing in the book becuz of the movie(well at least the important stuff). so i am sorry"
notsarc,298,"ohhh, okay. well, i guess since i don't know, i can't answer that question. i don't really know if i believe. i haven't been given a reason too, but i'm not set in that state of mind, and i acknowledge the potential and likelihood for god to exist.  i'm in the middle.  it's sort of like this (in terms of belief in god):  atheist-------------------agnostic----------------------christian "
notsarc,299,i have a reputation to maintain. most people stay on this site for about a year. i've been here for almost 3 years now? i guess you haven't learned that you shouldn't try to teach a pig to dance. nor have you learned that you shouldn't wrestle with a pig. you can't win and the pig likes it ;)
notsarc,300,"this man has a valid point. but i guess the people he mentions, the extremists and the racists will overlook his wisdom because that's the way they work."
notsarc,301,"i guess this disease is 'contagious' thus due to this contagious disease it can spread rapidly. if he dies then no one gets infected and vice versa. although, i believe that if that is the situation i don't the infected persons opinion matters. if you possibly may kill even 1 person you will probably be isolated from social world and be taken to a place where you have no contact with the public no questions asked."
notsarc,302,"theres no scientific studies that disproves nor supports them. so i guess yes, its 50/50 so more or less half of these are likely to exist right? every imaginary thing that i could make up, half of that is probable to existing if they all can't be proven or disproven?"
notsarc,303,"i guess you get some credit, but this seems to be way more effective."
notsarc,304,hey? what happened to prodigee's sock account that was cussing me out??? it used to be here... i guess andy deleted it. :(
notsarc,305,that means his life was aborted to. i guess you don't know what goes on during an abortion.  it's a pretty gross process.
notsarc,306,"i guess that you didn't look at my last link. there are recalls every year that effect millions of cars, and those companies are not being bullied by the government. the point is every car company has recalls, and the government is targeting toyota. ford, gm, buick all have recalls. why are they not targeted? so, the government is the almighty paternalistic big brother punishing those bad and irresponsible companies who only care about themselves and wreck endless destruction to society and the environment. no, toyota is committed to fixing faulty accelerator only because of accusations for causing accidents."
notsarc,307,oh thanks i guess it was you who have been upvoting my arguements huh ? xd thanks!  allies ?
notsarc,308,"i just love how you call it a baby and not 'contents of the uterus' or 'product of conception' or 'fetus'. the truth is, that was a child."
notsarc,309,"pride; a feeling of pleasure from one's own achievements, the achievements of those with whom one is associated i just love how you people try change how something is said just for your own self preservation. you are still being prideful, whether it's of yourself or of someone/something else."
notsarc,310,i love how hamas apologists require showing idf abuses to defend their actions. pathetic.
notsarc,311,"i love how the liberals are incapable of even getting mccain's age right. my idiot sister-in-law argued with me that mccain is 80! gimme a break. from your lips to god's ears, archangel. emoticonxangel"
notsarc,312,i love how brown got shut down. nom is a bigoted organization full of people who put out hateful and misleading propaganda that hurts and tearsat the struggle for equality tolerance in this country.
notsarc,313,i love how all you try to define what i believe? how do you know what i believe?
notsarc,314,"here's what i said: i love how the second clip of kids singing, all they say is 'can we make america better? yes we can.' and still that nut job is crying about it. here's what you said: 'yes we can' is kind of an obama thing, in case you didn't know. now, i'm not sure about what part of that makes you think that i don't know that 'yes we can' is 'kind of an obama thing.' but my point was that beck is insane, and it doesn't matter how good and unpolitical the message is, beck will always try to demonize anything even remotely connected with our president. which can only lead me to the question, why do you and glenn beck hate america so much? it's very unamerican of you."
notsarc,315,"first off, i love how you celebrated america's birthday in alaska with mexican food. lol. also, why 1am? what time does the sun set there? i know it's late, but how late? i went to holland in june 2003 and the sun was up well after 10. it was amazing."
notsarc,316,"i love how you broke that down, but why would anyone who feels content in their life, by into something that's telling them they are wrong? it seems like they are cutting out a big portion of their market with a certain sin that harms no one."
notsarc,317,i love how everyone on this side is downvoted. i upvote you.
notsarc,318,"oh, i was joking x) i love how i look and accept myself completely, most days. i do have those mopey days that nothing can convince me i look good x)  but you're right :)"
notsarc,319,"cbs sportsline is great, i love how everything refreshes quickly without having to refresh your page every five seconds."

notsarc,321,i love how it is 7 to 1.................. this is just the best.
notsarc,322,"yeah cartman is definately the best, i love how how epicly his evil is portrayed as e.g. scott tenorman must die"
notsarc,323,"i love how every line, except number 3, has a winking emoticon at the end. haha"
notsarc,324,"i love how the creator is also just like, sure whatever ."
notsarc,325,"i love how this guy screwed up the alignment on this page... but the basis of the argument is that evil is the lack of god, which makes it literally impossible for god to commit evil. but this raises the problem that god is then not capable of all things. he couldn't sin even if he wanted to. he is not all powerful. since he is not capable of doing something that even a weak human could do."
notsarc,326,"i love how i'm reading a serious answer and in the middle of it, ' rapture means rape in old french... have fun'. this is my ideal reasoning. to have an answer both serious, yet comical."
notsarc,327,"i love it when people say that bush got us into the war. it seems that the most educated people will forget everything they learned about the us government when they bad-mouth bush. so, in case you forgot, the decision to go to war must be approved by the very people we choose to go to washington and do that job, not just the president. if you are against the war, blame everyone who voted yes and stop whining that bush started the war, he was not a dictator."
notsarc,328,yeah horses are so cute i love it when they eat sugar right out of my hands it's so tickly
notsarc,329,"i love that you guys dont seem to be joking when you talk about it being offensive to gays - if anything i would think only tom cruise would find it offensive - because of his claims that he isnt gay (obviously untrue) gays would probably cheer if he (along with his penis) would come out of the closet if someone would find this offensive, it wouldnt be me vs gay guys - it would be me vs overly sensitive and selfrighteous guys who happen to be gay"
notsarc,330,"i love when people down-vote without giving an arguement as to why. guys, this isn't facebook, its a debate site."
notsarc,331,i love when they wag their tails and smile. awe. :) <3 .
notsarc,332,i love when my feet get rubbed after a long day. its really relaxing and i dont mind rubbing a mans feet.... as long as they don't stink
notsarc,333,i love when my feet get rubbed after a long day. its really relaxing and i dont mind rubbing a mans feet.... as long as they don't stink you are a woman after my own heart.
notsarc,334,"if they've started shooting they'll either have to terminate the movie or kill him off :/ like they did with the crow, i guess. i was pretty shocked when i heard about it."
notsarc,335,haha i don't hate him! he added me as an enemy! :p i was shocked when he did! haha
notsarc,336,"seriously man, i hope you don't believe what they tell you on that channel. it's just whoa. this one anchor woman was talking about how background checks led to registration than extermination; i was shocked. the thing with fox is, they put on whatever rupert murdoch wants."
notsarc,337,"i totally agree, while 9/11 was a terrible tragedy, america has been involved in some very shady dealings with the government and people supporting terrorism in other countries throughout history so while i was shocked and appalled by what happened that day there was part of me that thought you reap what you sow"
notsarc,338,"do you support legislation that would outlaw gay marriage? do you oppose funding nasa?  but abortion is quite different from any of those because it's giving people the right to kill something that is living. the government also supports hunting, granting hunting licenses to millions of individuals. the animals being hunted have a far greater ability to feel pain and emotions than the fetus in the womb being aborted.  i cannot see why the government should be able to legalize something that is clearly wrong, playing god in the process. because it's not clearly wrong. there are other opinions out there other than your own. all you seek to do is deprive people of their choice, and impose your will upon the masses. let's all be glad you are not in a position of power, for you would abuse it undeniably all in the name of 'god'."
notsarc,339,"14 or 12... that is a ridiculous statement. drinking can affect the brain growth, and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age. oh yeah let's all stuff up the new generations brains and crap.. smart idea. if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink. many around that age aren't able to find alcohol really. it would make the situation worse than making it better.. the increase of binge drinking would also increase, it is at where it now because usually a person of that age, if they are able, cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol."
notsarc,340,"i'm pro-choice because when i get pregnant, i want to chose whether or not i will abort it. i am not pro-abortion because i don't want to be forced to aborting my child when i get pregnant i am not pro-life, because i don't want to be forced to have my child when i get pregnant. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-abortion, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all have abortions'' you on the other hand go on and say ''hey let's give all fetuses life'' that's what makes you pro-life. i don't want abortion. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal. don't change the title, i just want people to know that we are called pro-choicers."
notsarc,341,"this is what your arguement would look like if you were talking about gun control: 'i'm pro-choice because when there's a threat in my neighbourhood, i want to chose whether or not i will buy a gun or not. i am not pro-guns because i don't want to be forced to buy the gun when there is a theat in my neighbourhood. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-gun, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all buy a gun!' i don't want a gun. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal.' the only choice pro-life and 'pro-choice' disagree on is whether there should be a right to abort in certain circumstances."
notsarc,342,"agreed. god does exist in some form, whether you want to call god a supreme being or whatever, there is a greater power out there thats beyond our comprehension. in the meantime lets all just get along"

notsarc,345,oh really? when did the story of him being on drugs come out? did you even listen to the police scanner on that night? you do know right that the entire story makes no sense whatsoever... right?
notsarc,346,oh really? show me evidence of people who fully died and came back. and i mean fully dead.
notsarc,347,oh really? this isnt cyber bullying. this is barely slander. you arent returning fire. this is stupid. freedom of speech isnt a two way street. you have restrictions. both legal and moral. what the hell is going on?
notsarc,348,oh really? like when? and when have you seen me drive? i hardly drive. now your the liar.  liar liar liar!
notsarc,349,oh really? i prove evidence to the subject and i don't repeat the same thing over and over again. i am not repeating anything over and over am i. i think you are the worst debator.
notsarc,350,"'christians have been just as bad' oh really? when? and if the only thing you can answer the crusades, that was a war started by muslims, and so-called christians fought back"
notsarc,351,"oh really?  science does not say 'we dont know x, y, z, but we want to know x, y, z, and so we observe x, y, z, and come up with our conclusions and claim it to be true, or not? (it's a question..) if scientists were too busy learning what is, then the science that is present now, would be non existent, because in order for science to learn and understand, it must be too busy learning and understanding what 'might be', or what it has not known, yet."
notsarc,352,"oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men."
notsarc,353,oh really? hitler placed fear in those who wanted to oppose him in germany. fear is the best weapon to crush opposition.
notsarc,354,"economic understanding does not come from a series of graphs and equations that come from a man who has no understanding of how humans work. the economy is not some mechanical machine, it is an organic mass of all 7 billion people of the world making millions decisions every day. behind all the smoke and mirrors, all this man said was this, in other words, concluded bullshit is still bullshit.  and your second point, companies also compete on a technological level, if they aren't as advanced as their competitors they generally go out of business because people want the better quality/cheaper product. what is the states incentive? getting re-elected? oh wait, thats easy to do when 95% of voters have no clue as to what is going on and only think about politics for 5 minutes during the elections."
notsarc,355,"oh yeah, and the only thing better on pc's is that they have more choices of games. but im satisfied with my mac."
notsarc,356,"oh yeah, i forgot that i wrote 'anti-gay,' i was thinking of gay films."
notsarc,357,"oh yeah, and i'm pretty sure my display picture has pissed off a lot of people, and if it has; i'm glad ;)"
notsarc,358,oh yeah. the things i do for fun just ruin my appetite. i like to look at bacteria under a couple of microscopes i have. sometimes i just place random bacteria together to see how they react. usually they dont do anything. if you do have questions don't be afraid to ask.
notsarc,359,"oh yeah, i forgot that you believe that the corporate media and corporate leaders have gotten together to create war and put innocents in jail. i will admit that the powers of the executive branch have gone way too far, but i still believe that being at war means we have to treat the enemy like our enemy, and not like american civilians. do i agree with the war? no. but that's only because i feel that we could have done this all with special forces and not with an invasion/occupation. i would still support detaining terrorists captured in battle/mission (and if they're americans, give them a proper trial, not a military tribunal or some bullshit like that)."
notsarc,360,"baby, i am going to publicly say that if it wasn't for you i would be so out of here . oh yeah and for merlin too"
notsarc,361,oh yeah!!! nice! (i couldn't find the real one... so this will have to do.)
notsarc,362,the main reason i'm even say that i'm a conserative is my ideology of fiscal responsibility. obama breaking the record on spending. gw not really a true conservative in the matters of budget. kind of shattered that reputation for the republicans. my main guy that i listen to and he is a genius on money is ron paul. i don't believe in all of his policies but when it comes to money and the economy he's the shit.  oh yeah stick to the debate. you can't make laws against teens near the same age that want to have sex. anybody every read the book or see the movie 1984?
notsarc,363,oh yeah same here. i sadly have no more tolerance for prodigee anymore. i highly dislike him. hopefully this doesnt sounds harsh.
notsarc,364,oh yeah. that is the one up-side of it. bleh! :p
notsarc,365,"oh yeah! i remember tulip. calvinism seems to be more realistic, as it's more correctly grounded in man's sinful nature."
notsarc,366,"oh yeah, cuba has extreme poverty, how stupid. that is not socialism the on:y thing you share in socialism is the surplus value, which no one deserves, the gov. uses it to but free life necessities. the labor value is something you deserve for your labor and you get to keep it because it is yours. you buy luxuries with it."
notsarc,367,"oh yeah, lets just say all the main people on comedy central."
notsarc,368,does the pacific ocean truly 'exist' ? oh yeah 3000! time to celebrate!
notsarc,369,"oh yeah, they all have a secret meaning to me, lol except the dna helix, i just really love biology x) i much prefer to have something permanent on me meaningful."
notsarc,370,oh yeah sorry about that. i totally agree with you. just a little bit lost in communication.
notsarc,371,oh yeah i said that because what he said was a sweeping statement and i was just pointing out what he posted is not always the case.
notsarc,372,"oh yeah, and robert a. heinlein for his amazing sci-fi work; most notably starship troopers and puppet master"
notsarc,373,"oh yeah! i remember that one... abbynestor was going off on everyone, so i told to to calm down and then everyone (including the people she was ripping on) starting yelling and calling me a dick.  like honestly dana got called a bunch of nasty stuff, i try to defend her and she gets snappy with me...like what? that's why i'm going to stay away from that stuff now."
notsarc,374,"1st calm down. 2nd. a fucking definition of bisexuals that they are only attracted to full males and full females from merriam-webster 'characterized by a tendency to direct sexual desire toward individuals of both sexes' i don't see anything about having to like full males or full females, sounds like something you made up to try to make a point. 3rd it's 'bi' not 'multi'. then why aren't pansexauls called multisexuals? oh yeah because there's still only two sexes, and multi means more than one and pan means all...sooooo... yeah they're the same thing"
notsarc,375,"oh yeah, i went to see the new movie a couple of weeks ago, it's probably the most interesting film i have seen in a long time. i actually bought the book because of the movie and i am going to read it sometime in the near future. looking forward to it!"
notsarc,376,"oh yeah... that... well... but what a sweet way to go, right ;)"
notsarc,377,then why america instead of britain (oh yeah) americas the more powerful one
notsarc,378,"i'm not 100% sure what set of facts you are working from, but they are not the correct ones i assure you. way more jewish people were killed than died in the iraq war. when you add everyone killed in wwii iraq is not even a comparison. let me make it clear, i'm debating the lesser of two evils here, (speaking of the war, i'm not for the assassination of bush. you can't kill someone for being an idiot, if so kill everyone who elected him, not just him... which would be more people than wwii and iraq war combined by the way)... where was i? oh yeah, there's no comparison. it's an evil (though crazy) ass who caused millions upon millions to die, vs. spoiled governor's son way too dumb for his position listening to douchebags like dick."
notsarc,379,oh yeah and then there is renegade by the styx... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iby32fcvtvs
notsarc,380,"i'm going to presume that you are a christian. why are you a christian? because you happened to have been brought up in a christian family. why aren't you a hindu? because you weren't born in india. if you were born in india, you'd be a hindu. if you were born in central africa, you'd be believing in strange mountain gods.  use your brain, however reassuring and pleasant it is, god does not exist.  oh yeah, and why won't god heal amputees?"
notsarc,381,"oh yeah, people think i'm a friend of my family's because i have none of their features. they all have brown hair, and i have blond. i have hazel eyes, and my family members have blue. which is slightly weird because most people who have blond hair have blue eyes."
notsarc,382,"oh yeah! i remember you man! welcome back. oh, thethinker may be gone but there's a few whack-jobs who have taken his place."
notsarc,383,"british kid with too much time on his hands. oh yeah, and he's a virgin."
notsarc,384,"oh yeah, outrage causes confusion, garchomp cant learn it except through cross breeding where the mother is garchomp so he is a garchomp, and the father is dragonite, haxorus, or salamance that knows outrage. and serperior cant learn hp ice because it doesn't exist unless you'd care to show how to get it."
notsarc,385,"oh yeah..., i saw that. they buried him in multiple little boxes ;)"
notsarc,386,oh yeah everytime you downvote someone you lose points so if you don't have that many you go into the negative.
notsarc,387,"oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you ""think"" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes. "
notsarc,388,"oh yes, i see your point. and strictly speaking i suppose it is true. it is more of a language inflection issue. when you say people only have value for me to use them, it translates to me as if i only value people that i can use. when i talk about using someone, i mean the process by which you manipulate them to achieve your own goals with no regard to them or their well being. this is not how i treat people, and not the only requirement for me to value a person. it is true that i only value people to the extent that they enrich my life, but the ways in which they do that are many, varied, and very different. so yes, i understand what you are saying, i interpreted it in a different way is all."
notsarc,389,"oh yes they do i am being denied my rights under the 14th amendment by the state of michigan currently with the state of michigan refusing to acknowledge my iowa marriage licence, while acknowledging other iowa marriage licenses."
notsarc,390,"considering the dumbocrats have held the house (which initiates spending bills) for most of that time, then you have nothing but more hot air. oh yes he does. he'll let them get the bomb, knowing they want to wipe out israel. not very bright of him. is he an anti-semite?"
notsarc,391,"oh yes i know what i stated, so answer the nonsensical question 'with qm'. is quantum fluctuation nothing? at which point it ceases to be a quantum vacuum; which begs the question has a quantum vacuum been 'observed' much less scientifically saddled with the responsibility of generating virtual particles (i know the question is so obviously self-contradictory i could barely type it with a straight face). lol, yes i've heard; but as i'm sure you know i am sadly ignorant of any 'new logic', and what's more intend to never accept it without it being supported by the old which puts me in an inescapable situation. is the ripple effect of space time nothing?"
notsarc,392,"oh yes you have. if your memory fails you, i can repost your statements."
notsarc,393,oh yes this is all over the news in ireland. irish farmers are having a canary that its the end of ireland's sugar industry. and cereal too because of crop rotation. nobody seems to have even thought of the question as to why exactly the eu should pay for an unsustainable industry as oppossed to farmers moving into something profitable. edit: oh and its tied into something about sugar being one of irelands few natural resources. emoticonxbanghead
notsarc,394,oh yes i forgot there are some who believe that the property of free-will permeates the universe and is shared by all things animate or otherwise. there is a mathematical proof floating around someplace of it. but since i do not think that there is in fact such thing as free-will i have not bothered to collect it. humans do not have free-will simply because there is nothing for human will to be free of.
notsarc,395,"and you can thank the unions with their inflated wage/benefit packages they strongarmed from companies/municipalities for the high cost.  oh yes it is. new york is the only state where pbulic sector jobs, which bring little to no growth to an economy actually outpace the private sector. and you still think that heavy industry is the end-all be-all to economic survival?? america has a dynamic economy, not static."
notsarc,396,"oh yes we can. invoking god is not an explanation for ultimate origins, it's the papering over of the absence of an explanation by declaring further application of the question off limits. simply declaring that god's origin doesn't need explaining does not make that so."
notsarc,397,"oh yes, the rhubarb is one of my favorites too. a fine choice..you get a cake emoticonxbirthdaycake"
notsarc,398,"so in what way are the sperm and egg not human pray tell? are your sperm/eggs from some other species? are they lizard life? elephant life? what kind of life do they have (and you admit they do) outside of human life? sorry but sperm and egg are human and they are alive, how can you deny both statuses? oh yes if both sperm and egg are living matter then the claim 'life begins at conception' is patently false. i will assume you modify that phrase now to be 'human life begins at conception' but that is also clearly false on the face of it."
notsarc,399,oh yes i forgot to answer the key question: where does information come from. its a simple answer. from a local decrease in the degree of disorder. ie a reversal of local entropy. see adami for a development in mathematical and biological terms.
notsarc,400,"as i recall the order of feet was left front foot, right hind foot, left hind foot, and finally right front foot. does that make you happy. oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1-4. ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other (obtained by a process known as reflective copy) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same. this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random. the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index. its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2, or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had. ftse-1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd 'gait'."
notsarc,401,"marriage is social support. the government, in supporting marriage, is giving social support to certain relationships covered by marriage.  you argue marriage should be left up to the culture institutions such as churches, government should only do the paper work. that's an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognized marriage. you don't want government to provide that social support, suddenly, now that it will include gays. oh yes, it speaks to the cultural relevence of government-recognized marriage. people would not feel sufficiently compelled to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which has no social relevence."
notsarc,402,"is also text found in the same article. well think about it have we not seen remoliding of society in the last few years with regard to family structure, economic organization, and social practices? did not the republicans run on the platform of remolding society in their image? tax cuts for the rich, attacks on the middle class, ignoring scientific resarch in favor of conservative values, turing off stem cell research, ignoring global warming data, switch back to favoring big iron industries like oil instead of continuing to catalyze high tech energy solutions, and of course last and not least starting foreign imperial wars pre-emptetively. oh yes lots of remodling going on there."
notsarc,403,"well there is also trade with indians, customs collections from imports, and the patent office and of course the passing of laws and legislation to implement the whole thing. oh yes lets not forget legal tender which is mentioned i think. and also elections."
notsarc,404,"do away with scholarships, too. oh yes. humans have a natural desire to learn. are ever learning.  besides, you don't need two to three years to prepare for these exams, nor do you need a public high school to help you prepare for them. teachers must assess all the time in order to teach. the issue there is not grades, but assessment. the appropriate methods varying, for different teachers. you believe that, because you don't know anything else."
notsarc,405,"oh yes, president obama also has to figure out how to get rid of the bush policy of lies and falseness bush people burrowed into the federal government by bush during his last days as president in order to thwart the spread of science, research and reality."
notsarc,406,"take another look. we certainly do have our hands firmly on the levers of power. sixty us senators, a substantial majority in the house, a president who represents the death of reaganism once and for all. a solidly pro-choice president and congress. a president and a congress who understand that each of us is responsible for all the rest of us. oh yes, this country will emerge from the bush depression and the optional bush wars with a new sense of direction and a new prosperity. by the next election, there will be so few congressional republicans that they can caucus in the mens' room - provided, of course, that larry craig has not returned for a visit and is using it for other purposes. the naysayers can either get on the train or get left at the station.emoticonxsmilie"
notsarc,407,"oh yes you can, the 'eternal word of god' is malleable; what do you think the clergy are for? four centuries ago they would have burned a gay person at the stake if it was certain. now they are 'disordered' but it's now a 'delicate' matter."
notsarc,408,"Abortion is about pregnancy - and whether or a not a woman wants to be or can sustain a pregnancy - physically, emotionally and economically.Nobody has to be a parent. That is why there is adoption, safe-haven laws, the signing away of parental rights - and oh yes, an ever growing population of dead beat dads.I am still waiting to see proof of all the mourning dads due to women having abortions. Most of those women are desperate and alone - or have the blessing of the father. "
notsarc,409,reckon you don't know much about christianity then.  when you can bust the resurrection of jesus christ then you might have something to argue about. until then your claim that christianity is untrue is simply a lot of hot air.
notsarc,410,"reckon you'll get an education in time that turning your back on jesus christ wasn't one of your better moves. there's still time to come to your senses, though."
notsarc,411,"um, if the critter in question meets all the sensual criteria i cited, i ain't gonna call it an elephant. reckon my empirical observations trump your philosophical maunderings."
notsarc,412,and i say you and everyone who denies christ is steeped in folly. reckon you'll see the errors of your reckless judgment in due time.
notsarc,413,"again you show your ignorance of 1st century jewish tradition/mishnah. a husband and wife are betrothed to each other for a year or so before they are actually married according to the jewish law. that explains why mary was still a virgin in the first place. in our culture they were referred to as married, but she was in fact promised to joseph so they were more like engaged according to our way of thinking.  and why are you completely ignoring the previous post as you always do? you ask a question, just ignore the answer, and then ask another question, or just make a disconnected comment. have you no response to the information i've already given you? for example, have you no answer for the modern jews problem in determining the promised genealogy of any self professed messiah that comes forth today, or in the future?"
notsarc,414,that explains figure 6 of the following? its a flood zone of a riverbed? how about other areas where there are trees growing through 2 separate coal seams? google image result for http://www.grisda.org/origins/images/24017-12.jpg this helps make my point about review of evolutionary books. my personal review of this small part of some book explaining how the petrified forest came to be because of a riverbed elsewhere is a big thumbs down. if that is the best you got i am looking elsewhere for answers. shame on you for accepting that from your evolutionary high priest. can you even see that no explanation was given?
notsarc,415,"that explains it, post 60, page 4. look what comes up for me. i have my forums settings at 40 posts per page. post 121 which came up was the first post at the top of the page.  regarding ip's, the region/part of the country or world they are from can be determined, so i'll make you an additional offer; if he shows that both easyrider and my ip's are located in the same town in nh, i'll still agree to being banned. i say this not knowing where rider is from but i assume he doesn't live in my state."
notsarc,416,mexico? that explains many things. mexico: candidates must address murders of women | human rights watch
notsarc,417,humans don't just have sex for procreation. humans have sex for pleasure. that explains the evolution of the clitoris and the bundle of nerves underneath the head of the penis.
notsarc,418,you fill your mind with the prattlings of glenn beck and rush limbaugh? that explains your character problem.
notsarc,419,Well that explains your anger.:p I hope you are blessed with homeliness.:) Makes your commitment easier to keep. How old are you now? 
notsarc,420,"Hello, please read http://www.reasons.org/resources/apo...ing.shtml?mainIt is a good christian site that explains that there are lots of problems with Dr Russell Humphreys' hypothesis.The universe and Earth are very old. We know this as a fact. Why would God lie to us? If the Universe looks old, then it is. To claim otherwise is to call God a liar. "
notsarc,421,"oh, so you can point out where i argued that birds were the apex species? no? what a shock you're right, right now, humans are the apex species. but (and i know you don't get this part), we are not the most evolved. all extant species are equally as evolved."
notsarc,422,"final, switzerland 1 spain 0. spain, one of the favorites or perhaps the favorite to win the world cup, loses to switzerland. what a shocker. of course with two more matches for all teams in this group anything can happen, but the pressure is on spain. they can not afford to lose another game, even a tie could mean not getting to the round of sixteen.emoticonxwow"
notsarc,423,wow. talk about condoning brainswashing. kids are being taught it's ok to be gay. they're not fairly allowed to make their own decisions. if they were given a fair chance of making their own decision i can gaurantee you it would be no where near that percentage.
notsarc,424,"wow, your quite vicious aren't you? i didn't call obama osama. that's mentally ill. i just said that is one freaky fact. mostly a joke, you know...those haha things.. wouldn't demoguy make you sound like you make or use demos =p"
notsarc,425,wow..its very informative and inspirational stuff i think...great works...keep it up...lloyd claycomb
notsarc,426,"wow. that is true. i'd say 16 and up, since a lot of people that are my age and below are pretty dumb, but then i myself couldn't participate in this site, and i like all the different points of view i get to see by being apart of it."
notsarc,427,"really? wow! my parents did the same thing! we had a water-cooler bottle that my dad put change into for years, and when we were little kids we went to cash it in, all of us helping to roll the hundreds of pounds of coins, and it ended up being worth over $900! ever since then, i've been a coin fanatic. people are so quick to throw away change. my friends know that i'll always take a nickel or a few pennies if they don't want to carry them around."
notsarc,428,bwhahahaha! now you are so arrogant as to think you can make up your own words? wow! what an idiot!
notsarc,429,"wow, thats pretty cool, not that i can afford it or anything. and i doubt it will be as common as the regular car is.  i'm serious about the broccoli though, you would think with all the amazing technology on this planet we could find a way to make healthy food taste good. instead we are making unhealthy food taste like crap.  think about it, broccoli is one of the most healthy foods on the planet, if you ate a full serving of broccoli every day it would increase your longevity by years. now imagine if it tasted just like hershey's milk chocolate."
notsarc,430,"why would it be immoral to lie to your child about santa clause? wow. you really are bad at this.... you're presupposing your position that harm is what is immoral. if the lie is to a person the person is the victim of that lie. you're presupposing your position..... you said that a victim is one that has been harmed, then you say that lying makes one a victim, but then you say that lying to your kids about santa is not immoral? i'm done with you."
notsarc,431,"really? i think war is one of those things the world absolutely learns nothing from. i mean, we're still fighting, so what exactly are we learning? to use a better and bigger gun? to make more disguisable spy planes? to train the military men more efficiently? wow. but in the end, does it all ever really solve anything? not in my opinion."
notsarc,432,"wow - sounds like a terrible idea. luckily we didn't all lock in on one belief while we thought the earth was flat and the center of the solar system, etc. why is that a terrible idea? if you logically look at all the beliefs only one of them can be true. by the rules of logic, if one is true the others are false. you can make the claim that you think they are all false but then you support the idea that your belief is true and the others are false so you're really in the same boat. that does not mean that you shouldn't be tolerant but tolerance does not require that you accept everything to be true."
notsarc,433,"money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant. i think that it can because money has fixed all of my problems.  come on! give me an answer to what can't money fix? leys say your one of those people that would die. how would you feel. i would feel however i was feeling before i died. in the debates hypothetical i wouldn't even know that i was going to die. many things are wrong with killing why cant you see that? wow! there are many things? to back up your assertion, list 5 of these things for me."
notsarc,434,"wow, what a cool suggestion! yes, this has happened to me before. thank you for the idea! would the individual clarify in the debate itself or in a separate argument/posting?"
notsarc,435,"wow, i didn't know it was that young! so there's no problem with porn stuff at 16 either."
notsarc,436,realy hellno? you downvote me for no damn reason? wow.
notsarc,437,wow. i can't believe they block it. it's not like facebook or porn. it's actually educational (sort of.) haha
notsarc,438,"wow, about a year and a half ago i was in your exact same position. i too was raised catholic but i felt questions about my faith. i eventually chose to become an atheist. i will not try to influence your decision, because ones own personal beliefs are just that: personal. whether you choose to remain a catholic, or become and agnostic or atheist i hope you will remain tolerant of others beliefs."
notsarc,439,"wow :) i'm just a starter, that's my first big tattoo (the debate picture, sorry about the glare, i had another sitting friday and it was lathered in tattoo goo!) i've had 5 hours on it so far, still got so long left but it's going to be a 3/4 sleeve once finished."
notsarc,440,"wow, it's really rare to see someone admit to changing their mind about an issue. definitely deserves an upvote."
notsarc,441,"wow, you got into stock trading with just $100? i had always imagined you'd need quite a lot of money to start out, so i never tried. i'm going to read up on this now ^^"
notsarc,442,"wow that's an excellent bit of knowledge. i didn't know that about the ps updates, i only had 1 and 2 and i felt like the hassle of continually buying a new one was not worth the free internet. also, as for the red ring of death on xbox, i guess i wasn't an extreme enough gamer to let mine over heat."
notsarc,443,"then prove me wrong. you want respect? then earn it. i'll give it to you if you stop meaninglessly attack me with your insults. i'm serious, i'll calm down the second you start delivering real arguments. and 'standard atheist attacks'? wow. you're so close minded, aren't you?"
notsarc,444,"wow, if you honestly believe that then you have been brainwashed by fear mongering and propaganda and you dont think for yourself, how does religion not do that? anyone who uses religion as an excuse for violence is extremely misled and should rethink their views, that doesnt mean religion itself is bad."
notsarc,445,"wow if this is what our society believes, that enlightenment is not important, well then i feel sorry for the age that i have been born into, if you would rather be kept in the dark, thats up to you, i like to be in the light of wisdom"
notsarc,446,wow i didn't know you were going to calculate that! well its true i do earn a lot of points a day and join and participate in a lot of debates in a day. also my 2nd year being here is coming up soon!
notsarc,447,"wow. just because people believe in god or claim so does not mean they have or use god as their moral compass. the god, i assume we are talking about the christian god, does not promote war and if we are to actualy follow what this god teaches and use god as our moral compass we would not go to war, but most people do not follow god as their moral compass and thus do go to war."
notsarc,448,wow what an awkward discussion. there is obviously no reason to sterilize when they are sexually retarded as opposed to mentally retarded and even then mentally retarded can have non mentally retarded children and some of them are able to take care of their offspring depending up the severity of their condition.
notsarc,449,"wow, 'stupid, selfish, anti-american'  i'm guessing you have something to back up such bold statements? or are you just talking out of your ass again?"
notsarc,450,"wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions "
notsarc,451,insult? i'm not sure if you're joking or just have a bad memory. but you have been making false assumptions 'aka' insulting me also. i'm not trying to insult you. i'm simply dishing out just like you are buddy. and i don't have to back up anything to a stranger i'll never meet. i know how successful i am and what degrees i have. all these false assumptions you're coming up with aren't phasing me at all. stop dishing out if you cant take it.
notsarc,452,"you seem to be lost in our jokes, you have to tell people you're joking so they know. and you got the punctuation wrong, in the russian phrase. the only way for it not to sound insane in russian, would be to put it as: '___ _ __. __'. calling someone '__', means things are serious, and you're ready for a fight. if you claim it to be a joke, you're just insane. so i assume that you got the punctuation wrong, and it was your signature."
notsarc,453,"you're joking, right? supporting tradition family values means devaluing any other type of family. by doing this, millions of lgbt individuals are denied equal rights. you cannot support heterosexual family structure and be apathetic toward gay rights at the same time. supporting heteronormitive ideals goes completely against giving equal civil rights to all gays."
notsarc,454,'whose illegal war? america isn't even there to be at war anymore!' wow. please tell me you're joking?
notsarc,455,"holy shi- what now?! i hope that was satirical of you, because while they should be punished, no one deserves the death penalty, especially children! they're just spoiled brats who'll grow out of that phase when they grow up. saying they should die is probably the most psychopathic thing i've heard in a while. unless you're joking. in which case, forgive my outburst."
notsarc,456,"pro-choice is a sexist concept. it only applies to women. pro-choice doesn't give you much of a choice. it sounds like what you're saying is that anything that has to do with only one gender, is sexist. if not, please clarify.  pro choice does give you a choice. you can either continue the pregnancy, or seek an abortion.  the pro life argument eliminates abortion and mandates that you continue the pregnancy (barring rape, etc).  if you're joking, then ignore this."
notsarc,457,"you're joking right? that's not even close. here's the verse just in case you read something else, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt with that: 1 corinthians 13:3: if i give away all i have, and if i deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, i gain nothing. this does not mean 'but not loved for it', but showing love."
notsarc,458,"i think in the mind of a psychopath with boundary issues, what the woman was wearing, or where she was at does not matter at all. how do you explain people who get raped in their homes? how about people who aren't dressing slutty, they're just having a drink with a friend, but that friend turns out to have a darkside? i really hope you're joking though."
notsarc,459,"i really hope you're joking. extremism is a disease, but not religion. religion can be, and is, for the most part, peaceful."
notsarc,460,i sincerely hope you're joking and not just an idiot for saying that i'm wrong for agreeing with myself.
notsarc,461,"i really, really, really hope you're joking. i point out that your bible is full of racist, sexist, abusive, psychopathic, perverted shit, and instead of arguing back, you just call me names. writing an entire paragraph in capitals does not make it right."
notsarc,462,"i don't know if you're joking or not but you made me laugh, thank you :)"
notsarc,463,"i'm pretty sure you're joking... but still, if one has the power to acquire and manipulate knowledge sufficiently well, then one can learn to protect himself from bombs and such. my house was recently afflicted by ants. massive amounts of ants. yet their numbers did not amount to much after the strategic placement of a few of these."
notsarc,464,your dispute seems like a very uneducated answer. does the wink mean that you're joking?
notsarc,465,"yeah even i have to agree you were making a joke. i may not agree with your stances on things, but i can see when you're joking."
notsarc,466,"okay, at least you gave an example for reagan. i personally think the russians were on the decline long before the end of the cold war, and reagan happened to be president when they finally fell, but we can agree to disagree. for bush i hope you're joking, because it has been quite clear that his policies have more than likely created more terrorists than he has helped defeat (not to mention the numerous other bad things he's done as president). in fact the only really good thing that came out of bush's presidency was that his unpopularity paved the way for obama to become president."
notsarc,467,"1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself."
sarc,468,"PROJECTION, again.... I'm amazed you can't recognise the amount you do it.... "
sarc,469,Your correct the research is sound and the conclusions are accurate. I am impressed you came to this conclusion without even reading it. 
sarc,470,"I can't believe that you would attempt to make such an insane assertion. Clearly, God was speaking about homosexual sex, but I'm not surprised that you left out the most unambiguous scriptural references. emoticonXRolleyes "
sarc,471,"what?!?!?! blasphemy!!!! where would i get my cd fodder from? fw: fw: fw: in the subject line is what keeps the points rolling in! without it, there would be no j.c.! how can you be so callous and insensitive?"
sarc,472,yeah you do a bunch of talking but mostly everything you say is meaningless banter. another troll eh? check. this site has many.

sarc,474,"really? damn! i wanna be awesome too. are you selling awesomeness or do i have to develop it on my own? if it's a lot of work, i might just settle on being mediocre."

sarc,476,so ridiculous =point whore? damn. your level of logic is astounding.
sarc,477,"Oh, yea. You are damn right those European socialists are dangerous. Americans might look and see their governments actually doing something USEFUL for the people and think that we should have that here.  I am surprised we have not nuked them yet. "
sarc,478,Those damn black people! All wanting respect and equal opportunity! They should just be happy with what they got!Why should they work for the same pay? They are just selfish! [/end sarcasm] This argument is tired *yawn* 
sarc,479,"Clearly you don't give a damn, because if you did then you would have to admit that you were wrong. Does this mean that you think the introduction of speed limits is a bad idea? "
sarc,480,"Aww, he is just confused. He has nothing to offer and when he first read the topic he XXX-umed that it was going to be a discussion of his noggin. The last thing we need is a damn limey board nanny. Play the ball old chap and not the man - famous limey quote "
sarc,481,You betcha. Even JP who usually can defend such stuff has failed. VOR doesn't even bother (not surpisingly consider it requires brain usage)   The mere fact they let him do that is damning aganist the Vatican. 
sarc,482,"oh, darling, doesn't it? if you are, as i believe, 'black', and conservative (heaven help you), to accept and embrace the republican platform, you essentially have sold your birthright down the proverbial river, because republicans care nothing for your black derriere, and would enslave you, all over again, if only they could.  you completely overlook 'white privilege', which dictates that a white person could be homeless, dirty, uneducated, drug-addled, and or criminal, and he would get a pass before you would, simply because of the color of his skin.  you've drunk the koolaid, and can't discern ca ca from truth.  and so you've joined with the white racists and pointed fingers at me, because i upset the applecart, and the status quo, and refuse to bend or mind.  again i ask....are you white? hispanic? asian? or black? not a trick question."
sarc,483,"youre not an idiot because you are black, you are just an idiot, sweetplums you believe that white people were created by a black scientist called yakub. anyone who believes this xxxx is a racist with the intelligence of a child.....seems to define you perfectly. you can shove the 1st amendment up you flabby arse. this is a worldwide forum...yes there is a whole world outside of the sexual deviant communities of texas. deal with it darling"
sarc,484,"bwaaaaaahahahahahaha!!! man this is funny. 'the joys of pregnancy'. that's rich!  you start out with constant peeing and projectile vomiting and when all is said and done you get to be practically ripped in two while you pass something that is 10 times the size of the orafice it is passing out of. but by the end of nine months you don't even fear the pain of child-birth as all you can think is 'get it out'!!!!!!!! for up until then you wobble, get your pelvis kicked the **** out of by the little darling, you swell, get constipated, pray for a confortable position to sleep in, develop vericose veins, stretch marks, and hemroids. hate to kill the romantic image, but even if you are really excited to be a parent and really, really want your baby - pregnancy sucks."
sarc,485,"mutzie, darling, is it absolutely necessary for a warrior to run with an m240 bravo while under fire, and also carrying a 70-pound pack. surely, warfare can be competently sized down so that 80-females can be deadly."

sarc,487,"that darling, depends on the ceo. :) i have met more than my fair share who did little more than take up space. i have also worked with senior leaders who kicked butt. what's interesting tho - is that in addition to driving results, they were the ones that valued their employees and were loved in return. personally i suspect it has something to do with them knowing how the work gets done.  (i also wonder how many ceos would diss the janitor if suddenly nobody would clean the can for them.....) in any case - i know enough about business to know that it is annoying and expensive to have to replace any employee. especially a good one. your elitism is so cute. sad, but cute."
sarc,488,"judeau, my christian science darling! where have you been? my faith rests upon you!"
sarc,489,watch out ez.dani thinks that you responding to my posts constitutes that you ' hang around' with people like me. we wouldnt want to make the little darling cry again lol.
sarc,490,"your reputation  la savoir faire with dirty notes precedes you, darling. no need for mommy's little boy to wiggle down his pants and expose himself some more. meaning, too, your ignorance, not mine, since the connection between the vietnam war, rubber production and american tire manufacturers is documented and known. go visit your local c.i.a. source for further information, dw, for starters.  be sure to take your teacher clown nosey with you."
sarc,491,"simone darling .the mans sperm creates the fetus with the ovum(or is it ova?) did no one tell you that? the subject is not about the fetus holders( we cannot say mother because the pregnant woman is not..by your definition..a mother) personal risk. if you are saying that only the people involved in a situation should have control of the situation you are opening a rather large can of worms. you may believe that a woman can deliberately destroy a sentient potential human but others may disagree. as a young nurse, nadine witnessed the horror of late abortions. now an mp, she says the law must be changed | mail online"

sarc,493,"the entire purpose to my life is for you to think of me as being oh-so-cute. glad to see you accept your raison d'tre. side note idea: raisin d'tre oatmeal cookies, tagline 'they are your reason to be.' why am i a quasi-anarchist? the government is evil. will anarchism ever happen in north america? if so, not for an extremely long time. the bilderberg group wouldn't allow it. i'm going to pinch your cheeks for making such a darling argument!"
sarc,494,you don't see me making similar knee-jerk reactions. woopdee fucking doo. but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with. well done darling. but being an american you should know that in marriage people choose who they spend the next couple of years with not the rest of their lives. now let's get back to the facts - where in an arranged marriage does it say the 2 people getting arranged don't have a choice?
sarc,495,"Sweetie, if every gay person were as wealthy as Mary Cheney, we could laugh all the way to the bank and ignore the prejudice in society the way she does. Indeed, we'd probably be the darlings of the GOP. Unfortunately for your delusion, gays are no more or less wealthy on average than anyone else. "
sarc,496,"My dear Sigma, I'd tutor you in logic if I thought it would stick. Notwithstanding anything that has been said before in this thread, are no better than is not interchangeable with equally as bad or worse than simply because are no better than does not imply that the thing following than is bad at all...while equally as bad or worse than does. Changing what a person says in an argument is a strawman technique used by many a poor debater. You wanted to get 'equality' into the argument where none was ever implied. Good day! "

sarc,500,not likely waxy: i just thought snakespit's scornful post would have been more effective if he hadn't used 'dear' three times when he meant 'deer'.
sarc,501,"he didn't, he said 'oh dear'. to have called you 'dear' clive14 would have typed 'look dear' or perhaps even 'my dear'.  what he actually called you a head case, a point that you appear to miss completely. makes me wonder how much you are paying attention to what we say emoticonxconfused"
sarc,502,"dear god.you really haven't a clue about what your talking about.away with the birdies i think.yousef was responsible for the 93 bombing,and he himself had very broad associations with some of the al-qaeda hardcore(osama said he didn't know him and was in sudan while yousef stayed in peshewer).osama wasn't responsible for the 93 bombing,he wasn't responsible for bali and madrid and i don't care what the world media tells you.but by all means keep spouting your misinformation,i for one find it hilarious. the yousef-osama-saddam link is a conspiracy theory."
sarc,503,"oh but he/ she is. his often speaks out to remind our dear mps that they are supposed to be leaders of our country, not school kids a playground. he does this by yelling 'order!' a lot. and he gets to wear a silly wig i think (or is that 'black rod'?)

sarc,524,and how do you know for certain provocateaur dearie? what evidence are you using to show that gaydom is different from a chemically based addiction to a drug substance? and what evidence is there that a person can't quit being gay and start being straight if they want to?
sarc,525,"whatever you need to tell yourself in order to accept being a subject of the government winston dearie. if you believe you're happier in a country home to the deadliest of snakes and spiders and can't even own a gun because somebody decided your fate for you long ago then who are we to argue? we'll run our country our way, your let your country run your life its way, and we'll stay out of each other's business and stop trying our country as having the better idea. hope you like being alone, bankrupt and dingo bit."
sarc,526,winston dearie before you decide to go flapping your gums at me over something you don't like i'd suggest you take the test first and see for yourself. the pictures are extremely stereotyped to the point of being racist caricatures that were popular in the early half of the 20th century.

sarc,536,how could you?! :'( all i wanted was to contribute to a fantastic community of geniuses!
sarc,537,That has to be a typo my friend. If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression!

sarc,540,"cute. but it misses the point. your rationale is like saying hadrian's wall is mis-named because hadrian wasn't out there putting or the rocks in place, but merely caused it to be made. i know the followers of many great leaders hid their leaders burial sites. for want of a better example i can think of attila the hun who was buried in a river 'somewhere'."
sarc,541,psh if i had to f*&^ hillary i'd cheat too! i mean i'm gay but lord have mercy! lol... but getting back to the subject at hand. simone hun honestly just stop with the cook theories and whoever else even believes them. bush and dick had no idea of 9/11 we all didn't.  i find it a sad irony that we discover the warning signs after the incident... we're only human and we all make mistakes... oh and fyi we did not land on the moon.. simone told me it was made of cheese and that there were giant moon rats eating and eating until one day the moon will be gone... that's why there are holes in it. it's true!!! honestly!
sarc,542,i know! i should totally be sorry and ashamed for being such a horrible liar... i mean a dick sucking homosexual and a liar! oh i'm going to the seventh circle for sure... except one little tidbit easilyridden. i didn't lie!!!  embarrass? hun you forget who wears the tiara in this forum....

sarc,544,"1868 actually, that is a link to the wikipedia article on the act. once again, the 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 are not the same thing. more importantly, a store saying 'no blacks allowed' is not violating the 14th, they violate the civil rights act of 1964. furthermore, a store saying 'no guns allowed' is not violated the 2nd amendment.  time for you to read up on the constitution doc, you might find some good things in there. i'm a little surprised you don't vote democrat given your thoughts. then again, not much difference between a given democrat and your texas 'republicans' (see w bush and rick perry)"

sarc,546,"i'm always astonished that creationists try the 'lots of cultures have stories about floods' gambit.  yes, lots of cultures have stories about many things. either there was one great flood at one time, or there have been individual floods. since humans tend to congregate in river valleys, i think i know why all the flood stories contradict each other..."
sarc,547,"i'm always blown away by the irony of seeing fundamentalists claim to grasp 'absolute truth.' nothing could be more blasphemous, by their own definitions: they place themselves in the position they ordinarily reserve for god. and then they accuse atheists of theological arrogance?!? please."

sarc,567,i guess i'm not really surprised at some of the reaction here: ignorant blather. i am dissappointed though. it's amazing what people will say about something with no knowledge of it. yes.
sarc,568,and yet you are angry over the ruling so all you can fling out as ammo is the judges orientation. nothing based upon the merits of the case or the details from both sides but only the fact that he is gay. coming from you i'm not surprised in the least. oh and wonderful quotations insisting being out is a detriment and saying someone is jumping out of normallicy simply because they support marriage equality..
sarc,569,"she was never 'pro-gun' to you people. she was an anti. omg they reported on something. not exactly ready to help her reputation out before she was shot, though, were they? you have lots of bros that are lunatics. and one of them just shot and murdered 6 people, including a federal judge who was sitting on an immigration case and a congresswoman who opposed to arizona's immigration law. arizona: your land of cowgirl jan and cowboy sheriff joe.  i never heard of anyone who truly understood what a soul was, who thought they didn't need a mirror. i'm not surprised you think yourself at the level of god himself, able to judge who has a soul and who doesn't. it's the same psychology your bro with a gun just demonstrated."
sarc,570,"you have some good points but a whole lot of gibberish too but you forgot to say why you feel that?????? why did you forget and just go for the insult?? too silly! conservatives have always been very open about their disagreements with rand, but many also welcome her as a very very powerful ally against liberalism. i'm not surprised that you didn't know that what lack???????? what hypocrisy????? of course it does. many countries don't accept immigrants, it is a huge upheaval personally to do so, and most countries will be more liberal than the usa. certainly that is one option most sensible people would utilize when possible. what?????????"
sarc,571,"justincredulous, i'm not surprised that you cut and pasted a comment out of context to make a point. it isn't beneath you to do so. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,572,"that doesn't suprise me. again i'm not surprised that your first reaction to the idea that people aren't equal would be to enslave some and that your second idea would be to subjegate women. this reveals way too much about your nature. it ain't pretty. try living homeless for a year then get back to me on whether you saw yourself as equal to someone on '1million a year' emoticonxrolleyes now if the '1million a year' person gave the homeless person 1/2 million a year, then they would be equal, because equality is at the entre of such socialist ideals."
sarc,573,"well, you haven't been right too often on this forum, so i'm not surprised. :)"
sarc,574,"winston's from australia where guns are banned and abuse of women is almost 10x higher than the us. maybe there's a correlation there? emoticonxkill  either way, i'm not surprised that you started yet another male bashing thread. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,575,"anyone else see the irony? i don't have time to look up my facts, but i'll just say my opinions are facts!  let's just ignore that overall, republican adminstrations have more officials indicted or convicted of state & federal laws. nixon's adminstration alone accounts for many of the republican number (golwater called nixon the most dishonest person he'd ever met in his life). and do we need to remind jim of the ratio of republicans who have gone to jail or been indicted compared to democrats in the past 6 years?  right. strom thurmand laughs at you from his grave.  with a ideology like that, i'm not surprised."
sarc,576,go back to the part in which we were discussing a specific case and stop trying to encompass the universe in your justification. (you know there are mothers in bokoboko that don't have enough lizard eggs to feed their babies so they eat them)emoticonxbanghead  i'm not surprised that a moral definition of selfish disgusts you. splat! :)
sarc,577,"another attack from one who claims to be a loving christian. oh well, i'm not surprised."
sarc,578,"then explain why the moon isn't burning, after all, it's significently larger then any known comet.  this is beyond ignorant. explain how something far smaller then the moon could sustain nuclear fusion for millions of years yet brown dwarfs which are larger then the moon can't.  coronal mass ejections are not even similar to comets. we have evidence of what comets are. spectrum analysis of light given off by vaporization tells us exactly what they are made of. given your comments, i'm not surprised that the scientific contributions of the islamic world over the past 50 years have essentially been nothing."
sarc,579,"since we're at war with radical islam and they have attacked our homeland once already and have promised a repeat performance. it is ludicrous, irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigating people of islamic descent before allowing them entry to be a discriminatory policy. especially since terrorists don't fight like men but are committed only to hit and die/run sneak attacks. but i'm not surprised that you're blinded by political correctness when you should be concerned about your families security. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,580,"child, your assumption is not only simplistic, childish and patently ridiculous, but it is coming from you so i'm not surprised at all that you're making it. you can deduce and somehow read into my rejection of your statement being evidence of anything is claiming that christianity is the only religion, but i made clear above that my only intent was to show that your claim that your siggy proves anything at all is patently absurd. but make of it what you will. i'll give you the last word to spew your lies and delusions about what you want to say i believe. so have at it little boy, er, i mean, child. emoticonxbye"
sarc,581,"oh, i see now. it's your inability to speak the language that we're dealing with here. bill o'reilly was just quoted in the piece, he didn't write it. and yes, i would believe o'reilly before moyers in a heartbeat. but i'm not surprised you would consider it a deranged hit piece though, since it hits so close to who and what you are."
sarc,582,i'm not surprised anyone would interpret that way. who knew that protecting our daughters actually meant protecting them from harm?
sarc,583,"it's more along the lines of you saying you were going to do something... ... and posting it ... ... then deciding to erase all evidence of what you said you were going to do after you decide you don't want to follow through. care enough to make this post, eh? ironically, it had to do with you not coming back to this thread anymore... but yeah. i'm not surprised you *wouldn't remember* that... emoticonxfrazzled"
sarc,584,"which post do you think most accurately demonstrates archie's ethics? is it the one(s) where he denigrates gays? the one(s) where he accuses those who disagree with him of being filthy, rotten liars, but is incapable of providing an example of their dishonesty? maybe it's the one(s) where he goes off on an insult laden rant that manages to break damn near every point of the tos? since i've just listed pretty much all of his posts, which one demonstrates archie's impeccable ethics the best? seeing as how you just accused a perfect stranger of having no ethics, simply because he disagreed with you, i'm not surprised you feel a kinship with archie."
sarc,585,"i'm not surprised that you didn't get the point that i wasn't really questioning his spelling when i replied to his 'you are heavy on the inane claims... ' with 'you mean accurate claims. your spelling sucks. emoticonxrolleyes ' but rather his statement. but that's ok, we know some people have difficulty with adult concepts such as sarcasm."
sarc,586,"i'm not surprised that you side with them. you're three peas in a pod. my point was that constantly beating dissenter over the head with the bible is counter-productive and the antithesis of jesus' message.  i suggest that if your goal is to fight all religious challengers, you're in the wrong religion. you should be muslims. muslins want to beat non-believers into submission, not christians."
sarc,587,"according to what you mentioned previously, you violated the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy and came out of the closet, disrupting your unit. real classy, jazy. your gay sex sin took preference over honorable service. but then that's your idol, so i'm not surprised."
sarc,588,"really? lol i'm honored that my attention whoring has inspired you x) and don't even thinking about surpassing the master! it will ensue a civil war.  i'm not surprised. he plays a little rough with the rest of my pets. though jum, the elephant, doesn't look the same without her tusk..."
sarc,589,"look. it responded again. i swear, it just gets funnier. look at how far he's managed to fool himself: ' you are pissed at me for simply speaking the undeniable truth. does the truth normally piss you off?' lol. i'm not surprised that a skinhead and potential kkk member thinks that his perspective is absolute while everyone else's is inferior."
sarc,590,"wow, in your very warped world view, people with moral values that defend the most defenseless among us and speak for those who can't speak for themselves are seen as morally perverted by you? how terribly pathetic of you capo. but sadly, i'm not the least bit surprised at how incredibly shallow your perspective is. what boggles the mind though is that you're unable to empathize with a whole class of human beings whom you once were yourself. just think about it capo, can you see what that say's about you?"
sarc,591,"i'm quite surprised this hasn't got more attention. usually all you have to do is whisper the word abortion around here and there's a firestorm. not that that was what i was going for, i'm just surprised. maybe this article is just too straightforward for people emoticonxangel"
sarc,592,"it's the first time i've seen you in that light, and i don't like it either, i'm really surprised at your stance on this one. don't let all those televangelists out there in on your secret passage. :p  for anyone who uses the bible, or interprets it in such a way, as to justify something that would seem contrary to reason or the 'core meaning' of the bible. imho, that's where the trouble starts. waxy"
sarc,593,"i'm shocked. have you been crossdressing? you can have mine when i get breast cancer and die because you didn't use the cool new pink google :/ they're fake, but you don't have to tell anyone"
sarc,594,i'm shocked that people side with illogical arguments rather than logic.
sarc,595,"i'm shocked! people are downvoting your obama has almost the same number of letters as hitler argument... they must be nazis. uh-oh, george has exactly the same number of letters at hitler - does that make him more like hitler than obama??"
sarc,596,"i'm shocked! shocked, i say!!! you seem so pure! roflmao....sorry!"
sarc,597,"dude, check my results. i'm shocked. i answered honestly. wow. you were def right, i aint no liberal. o.o"
sarc,598,once again i'm shocked to find myself agreeing with randomdude. then again his arguments seem well constructed and logical next to debates (and the consequent points you make on them) like 'is my country the best country' or whatever it was called.
sarc,599,"so.... whats he been doing for the past two thousand years? i'm sure this rapture probably requires a lot of paperwork.... i mean, if you're going to torture and murder millions of people i guess you better have all your t's crossed and i's dotted huh?"
sarc,600,"to be honest, i'm surprised it was that hard to give a corporate handout. any big insurance company and big drug company is delighted since their competition will now be squashed and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a higher price. but hey, a for effort, right? emoticonxrolleyes you don't get points for failing to deliver or delivering a failure in my opinion."
sarc,601,i'm surprised that some of the more frothing liberals here have not yet suggested that we now have a way of tracking and potentially treating the 'abnormal' brains of conservatives.
sarc,602,"i'm surprised that some people still don't realize that not everyone thinks the same way they do emoticonxrolleyes  i, for example, detest children, have no desire to have any of my own and in fact would genuinely fear for any children i might have or are under my direct care. my family is generally bad tempered and 1 in particular has children that pretty much everyone feels sorry for because of how strict this relative is. but hey, as long as you can sleep better knowing you restricted her 'freedom' it's ok, right? you're right :) abortion is one of her options."
sarc,603,"i'm surprised no one has unearthed some stickman figures and announced that the drawings of jesus have been discovered, as recorded in john 8:7, where he's doodling on the ground while some poor young woman is about to get pelted with rocks. what a pilgrimage that would make..."
sarc,604,"the nice part. i'm surprised that you've even read the bible. presumably you're commenting on 1 thessalonians 5:2, wherein paul admonishes the greeks to be watchful for the coming of god? the funny thing is that all of my bibles say that."
sarc,605,i'm surprised he hasn't made a shameless plug for his bible: mein kampf. :p
sarc,606,"thanks for clarifying the point i was making to simone. with all of your difficulties with comprehension, i'm surprised you got it. emoticonxsmilie"
sarc,607,i just like the author...i'm surprised a single person even knows who he is with the level of society's litterary intelligence. emoticonxsmilie
sarc,608,"i'm surprised cindy sheehan and the radical left aren't wearing turbans and funding al queda already, as much as they despise america's war on terrorism. but maybe some of them are."
sarc,609,"neither; he was a deist who felt that the bulk of christianity was ridiculous. [source] clearly, jefferson's 'real christian' is hardly at all a true christian. in fact, jefferson felt that the beliefs that evangelicals hold today were absurd and irrational. rather than address my points in the slightest manner, your response consists entirely of this. (think i'm surprised?) and you somehow think that i'm the one being defeated? but then, with your 'understanding' of logic, nobody's surprised."
sarc,610,"i'm surprised to learn that you have the slightest idea about biology. also, your spelling and grammar is ever so much better in this post than your posts in another thread. how many of you are pretending to be a poster named vt?"
sarc,611,"much more is happening in the world today than your little gay crusade matthew. but keep your single issue, and totally limited perspective in life, that's what you're good at. could you post where i said that revelation speaks to the rcc vs the protestant reformation ms ? as christ was a jew trebor, his followers wont ever cease to exist, just as god has preserved the jew according to his promises. i'm surprised you can't appreciate that my friend."
sarc,612,"well, it's nice to know my assumption there was a dishonest ulterior motive (rather than actually wanting to discuss it) to the request was indeed correct. can't say i'm surprised though. this poster has consistently avoided actual discourse with most anyone with whom he'd find real disagreement (gasp!) for as long as i've known of him, usually choosing instead to throw his easy 'drive-by' insults from the peanut gallery. basically, he's a coward, and most anywhere else would probably be considered a troll."
sarc,613,i'm surprised he didn't google it. maybe that's too logical?
sarc,614,"true, though they can't have been going against the bible as it didn't exist then. how did people decide what was right or wrong before the bible came along? all those millennia without a moral guideline, i'm surprised the human race ever made it (or any other race for that matter). emoticonxangel smiley emoticonxangel"
sarc,615,"as i said, for clarification, and no other reason. it's all drivel to me anyway, so i didn't see the problem in adding evolution onto theory. show where it said that if you would, and clarify your question. if you'll notice, it said approximately, not exactly half its life. i'm surprised you couldn't deduce that by just reading what it said. why are you asking me this question smiley as if i wrote the article? can't you tell the difference between quoting a piece and writing it?"
sarc,616,"given your proclivities, i'm surprised that you are not praising president clinton to the skies for supporting your supposedly moral pov. now, shall we examine mccain & governor gidget's views on the topic?"
sarc,617,"oh gee, they wrote letters threatening to publish names of companies that supported the activists. how horrendous as your side justifies its activities. how terrible is that? did they converge on those companies enmasse with placards and prevent people from gaining entrance, or not wanting to go through the crowd for fear of being attacked? no! but in your mind, writing letters is evil yet you're blind to what your side is doing. i wish i could say i'm surprised at your hypocritical position, but i'm not.  did blacks protest white churches after the people voted against civil rights or prevented blacks from registering to vote? prove they did that foundit. they had marches down main streets and picketed city hall's. not private citizens in their places of worship, and you know it."
sarc,618,telling of what?....that some imaginative authors created fantasy stories wherein guns were unnecessary for the champions to win? that has no bearing on reality. i'm surprised that you tried to extend that into real life.
sarc,619,"in that case its a single act of terroism so if you know all of this what's the name of his group? i wasn't on a high horse. also could you post the source saying he was part of some group and not just a loon.  jeez that sucks. *shrugs* well no different from black leaders who were targeted, slave owners/abolitionists who were targeted. this happens all the time. i'm surprised it hasn't happened earlier. i love how its a conspiracy! *roll eyes* its terrorism not a conspiracy. unless you gonna tell me the governments in on it. xd"
sarc,620,"i'm surprised archangel hasn't jumped on this.  he's gullible enough to fall for tv props, why not this?"
sarc,621,"geeze, oldsarge, i'm sorry you missed the rabies shots when they were passing them out. i'm surprised to see you still around frothing at the mouth."
sarc,622,"you really need to stop reading such biased, uninformed digital-age fishwrapper. i can think of at least one instance off the top of my head, justice alito's confirmation. the democrats threatened to filibuster bush's scotus choice. the gang of seven democrats agreed not to filibuster in return for the republicans not to use the 'nuclear option'. it was in all of the papers. i'm surprised that the leftwing rag missed it. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,623,"btw, jazyjason, before you edited out your complimentary comment about howard dean. just wanted to say i'm surprised you said anything to associate yourself thus with a such an irrational far left commie. must stay with the mudflingers and lynch mobs and, especially if they're jesus lovers, ya know. so ... i understand why you took it down. merry christmas."
sarc,624,"you don't see him leading the pack, do you? no family jewels. i'm surprised he doesn't run to canada. emoticonxchickenemoticonxchicken"
sarc,625,"i'm surprised that your picture doesn't precede the phrase 'ignorance of actual american history' in every encyclopedia on earth, simone. emoticonxdonno emoticonxfrazzled emoticonxic emoticonxwow"
sarc,626,i'm surprised that so many people got their knickers in a knot over the ramblings of pat robinson. emoticonxwow
sarc,627,"running away again? typical. you come in and derail the thread from its original discussion, offer up your p***y pacifist propaganda, quote selected verses in the bible to make it look like you've got support from god, and then you turn tail and run when confronted with the facts that prove your position wrong. not that i'm surprised. what else can you expect from a man who wouldn't even defend his own family against danger?"
sarc,628,"perhaps you should smoke a lot less crack? funny isn't it how the people who say that invariably want a larger government? btw adam smith, aka 'miguel sanchez', is a prominent mexican free market economist and spiritual leader of the latino pride movement, with suspected ties to people smuggling and drug trafficking operations along the californian border. his magnum opus the wealth of mexicans details an insidious plot to bring down racial equality through free market principles, estabilishing a millenium of full spectrum mexican dominance of the american financial, legal and industrial systems. the only barrier to his evil plot? patriotic americans who understand the benefits of government control in all aspects of their lives. i'm surprised someone as educated on such a diverse array of issues as yourself hasn't come across him."
sarc,629,"i'm surprised. i was sure you'd have read her essays on capitalism, but i guess only so many books are required before you can defend proper economics."
sarc,630,it is logically impossible to have no beliefs. i'm surprised you even know what 'logic' means or what being 'logical' entails given the poor quality of your arguments.
sarc,631,lol bias dysfunctions. i'm surprised you know such a long word. pity you don't know what it means. i can't blame you... being a retarded ignorant white woman. you don't even understand the absurdity of your own beliefs. go back to cleaning the house. worse is that you don't work yet you take the piss out of immigrants who work but don't pay taxes. you're better how?
sarc,632,jesus christ srom!!! you live in the stone age... i'm surprised you have internet access.
sarc,633,and nobody knows google better then the man that googles everything.  still hunting for excuses bohemian? i'm surprised you didn't yell fallacy. invalid and uncogent must be today's words for the day. i'm sure we will all see them used in other debates throughout the remainder of the day. can't wait and see what is tomorrows word.
sarc,634,with such eloquent and compelling arguments as this i'm surprised it hasn't happened already.
sarc,635,"... are you asking me for evidence that this debate doesn't name specifics? er, then as evidence i submit this debate. you mean your grandkids. and again, hair is apparently more important than policies to the right wing. i'm surprised you didn't just make an acronym of my name, that woulda shown me what's what. no, republicans don't have the majority and they likely never will again until they change their backwards ways. what the republicans have is a bought and paid for propaganda machine called fox, and a band of old fat people scared of their own shadow (not to mention afraide of the scary black guy in office) who will believe any psychotic conspiracy fox throws their way. republicans won't have the majority after this midterm, and the republicans are going to lose more seats when obama is re-elected in 2012."
sarc,636,yep. you got it.  i'm so busted.  seriously. you were a lot closer with the 'abusive participant' thing and i'm surprised that you (of all people) took the line that you did. cheap shots like that are not something that you are known for.
sarc,637,you are an idiot and i'm surprised you are able to navigate the internet with a computer. anyone who actually knows how to use a thesaurus can see your incompetence and dishonesty for what it is.
sarc,638,"no i'm not. well you certainly should be. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? wow...i'd say i'm surprised but i'm really not. so you're saying that people who don't want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex are on an equal playing field with those who properly applied protection which failed? that's ludicrous and you really should know better.  well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either.. you left out a few important details there buddy. with the killing of a 3-month old with an axe you have no baby. but its the same result! yippee!"
sarc,639,"Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure. "
sarc,640,"i have several that i want everyone who engages in the 'man caused global warming' debate to consider.... and i thank you for helping to illustrate some of those points for me (bold text above). asside from the points we've already discussed,... i am a bit intrigued by the fact that many of your ilk (concerned about saving the lives of millions by reversing or slowing the warming trends of the planet) are seemingly oblivious and uncaring about the millions who are deliberately killed in the name of 'choice.' isn't the decision to drive an suv a choice as well? emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,641,"it was germany's drive for nationalism that led to britian's defeat, wwll. want to rethink your position? news flash, britain won ww2, germany lost. i am actually astounded that you didn't know that."

sarc,643,"i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti-gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate, and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as 'oppression' and how gays could have it worse... emoticonxdonno  just out of curiousity, do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong?"
sarc,644,"emoticonxrolleyes  like i mentioned, i stopped using the 'l-word' because steeeeve and another kept shifting the focus of the conversation to demand that i prove that they knew they were telling a falsehood. boringly enough, their antics completely neutered threads into meaningless squabbling. the discussion about the topic of the thread stopped completely. they often did not even tried to debate that their statement was not false. steeeeve has a lovely habit of ignoring what he can't cope with. i am amused at how my name doesn't seem to be the focus of any of these 'liar!' threads, but that doesn't stop me from bringing me up here. obsess much steeeeve?"
sarc,645,"the same could be said of you... little jimmy is torturing small animals, but don't worry. he isn't killing anybody... < end sarcasm > the quote in question. 'i want to see them as radically laying down their lives for the gospel. as they are over in pakistan, in israel, in palistan, in all those different places...' it references some pretty serious hotbeds of violence. not just *figuratively* committing your life to god, but people killing in god's name. people dying in god's name. plus, she explicitly states 'radically laying down their lives'. not *figuratively* laying down their lives. she chose a word that indicates elevation of action. quite frankly, i am astonished that you don't seem to have any concern over her statement. you write it off without even bothering to look at what she actually said."
sarc,646,well i always assumed i was the biggest harry potter fan. i am astounded to learn that historical facts support it. i thought it was the creation of someone's imagination as opposed to jesus who historically existed whether or not he was the son of god. emotions run way too high on both side in these kinds of arguments so you end up with one party belittling in not so subtle ways another and vice versa as though it's clever and wins them points. :(
sarc,647,"there is no problem in what you 'believe' in. science is irrelevant in many beliefs. just sole belief in a deity and his disciples, is what many religions revolve around. but, i am astounded by your god's name, no harsh feelings. a dragon lord king is quite a mouth full don't you say? can we just call em, greeble. :)"
sarc,648,"oh my gosh i am bloody stunned! speachless(almost) even.you are an absolute genious! oh if i knew how to type bowing to your feet, i would.thankyou.sincerely dacey."
sarc,649,"so your saying dr. tiggerroo, that my parents decided i would be gay for me. fascinating. do you have any other amazing rubbish to spit out of your mouth. i am captivated by your amazing intelligence on this subject. it sound like you have been studying this all through kindergarden. grow up, get a clue."
sarc,650,i am equally astonished you two road apples don't recognize satire when you see it emoticonxgood
sarc,651,"it's my first day and i'm already wishing forums had an ignore button. this really is my first day, and i am frankly flabbergasted. is this (archie-types) an ongoing problem here, or an isolated individual? i feel like i'm arguing with my 6 year old niece. i'm asking everyone out there who has been there for a while. seriously. as a former christian, i have numerous christian friends whose conversation and opinions i respect and think i could learn something from - but, well...jesus, is this the norm around here? this is not a rhetorical question."
sarc,652,"i am impressed you are impressed by that backward-minded bigot who's main insight was a mere claim without justification on any form of harm to the institution of marriage and said, 'fuck the fags'? come on dude."
sarc,653,"archie, it's already 'cleared up' that you're a liar. you claimed to know what he was about. you claimed it was a 'secular site that's dedicated to exposing the homosexual, extreme left, communist and anarchist agenda'. but he's not really interested in 'homosexuality' at all. and i find you're 'couldn't find it' to be incredibly absurd. it's on the web-page where he talks about the event in the first place. if you actually start clicking to see the pics and his comments, it's right there! i'm not linking to pornographic material on this web-site. the header of that web-page reads:  'up your alley fair san francisco, july 27, 2008 part 1' i am incredibly amused that you repeatedly lie all over the place on this web-site, but then you press others for proof."
sarc,654,"woohoohoo, diogenes, talk about twisting my statements, wow! wow! i am just plain flabbergasted!"
sarc,655,"leroyjames, i am just shocked at your blatantly sarcastic response to kelly ;)"
sarc,656,"i am mildly surprised steve hasn't argued that if we recognise gay marriage, we will have to accommodate the hoards of americans eager to marry their buicks, dogs and dead relatives. after all, if we lift one of the unreasonable restrictions on marriage we are compelled to lift every single last reasonable one. makes sense, right? emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,657,"i am more amused than anything else. i don't have to 'attack your character', you do a much better job at showing exactly what you are made of than anybody else can."
sarc,658,i am none too surprised to see that the point was totally and utterly lost on you.
sarc,659,what is the point of arguing that life arose via evolution? at the rate you generate it i am not surprised.
sarc,660,i think you underestimate the intelligence of a 6 year old and what they can comprehend............... and that 6 year old is not only the people but the future which makes it even more imperative that he or she know the sacrafices others have made to make this country the great country it is........ i am not surprised you call it brainwashing though....... emoticonxrolleyes
sarc,661,"well, i am not surprised you think science is a cult. i guess you think everything you don't understand is a cult. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,662,"my point is entirely relevant to exposing those who make false claims about the interests of 'sanctity' of marriage, or 'traditional' marriage. yet i am not surprised you refuse to address it. emoticonxrolleyes listen jyoshu... did i say it was? i pointed out that it would be obvious that love should be more of a qualifier than 'man/woman'. yet again, no surprise from me that you refused to address that. are you serious? courts look at emotions all the time. particularly in family court. regardless, you're avoiding the point i am really making. the point is about the 'pro-family' side who are 'protecting' an institution which doesn't even care about love. and logically, the 'pro-family' side should be able to recognize that, and their indifference to it demonstrates how much they don't care about such concerns either..."
sarc,663,"you can't 'drop' what you never had in the first place. he was never a 'gay pride' person. he's a gossip columnist who happens to be gay. he uses his 'gay' thing like a prop, the way some politicians use 'christianity' as a tool for votes and attention. i am not surprised you can't tell the difference... emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,664,"emoticonxwow archie, i realize the following will be wasted on you, but i'll say it anyways.... there is a huge difference inbetween a 'spiritual' issue... and a demonic one... the fact that christians look at 'homosexuality' as a spiritual issue is one thing. blaming it on demons and invoking an exorcism is quite another. and thus, archie places himself firmly in the 'exorcism' camp... i am not surprised... archie, there are a lot of christian reparative therapy groups out there. by and large, they don't work with 'exorcisms'. do you think they should be working with 'exorcisms' to rid people of homosexuality???"
sarc,665,i am not his buddy. my objection was that you thought he was english( please tell me he's not) and that your perception of english people was wrong and insulting i do not care whether american ( or should i be a prat like you and call you a yank?)people carry guns or not and have never supported his argument. looking at some of your stupid smug posts i am not surprised that you need a gun for protection. look in the mirror fella and you will see penfold mk ii.
sarc,666,"and it is the nature of conspiracy theorists to stumble upon some small fact and let their very large imaginations run away with it to the land of make believe bullshit. so i am not surprised that your conspiracy theory has some element of truth to it; i would be surprised if it didn't. this doesn't make it all true, unfortunately for you.  fortunately for you, you're a religious nutjob in addition to being a conspiracy theorist, so you don't actually need to worry about the truth; you have faith! damn the evidence, this is all about adapting the truth to suit your own narrow preconceived ideas. sorry, not your ideas, per se, rather the ideas foisted upon you that you preach to others."
sarc,667,"what i do recognize is a tendency by some people to obfuscate the point of a thread, and totally ignore its validity / invalidity... 'tongue in cheek' is irrelevant to my point. typo... should have read 'climb on board', but i guess the more pointless and menial complaints to side-track from the original comment, the better, eh? emoticonxrolleyes i am perpetually amused at how the republican party has gone from a) insisting that we cannot judge bush now, because history will be his judge as to the adequacy of his presidency, to b) insisting that after only a few months, we know for absolute certainty that obama is a failure. my how the worm turns..."
sarc,668,"this seems like a begging the question fallacy. lets just assume that they 'do not' have control over it...it would be the same thing for an alcoholic (which people are also born with). are you saying alcoholics should be allowed to live in this lifestyle? i guess it is societies fault emoticonxrolleyes looks like jyoshu's reactions were correct for you i am pretty surprised no one is like 'yeah, this is still a problem'..instead they are going '25%...that aint too bad'. even worse, they blame other people. in fact, robbie says gay men are acting 'recklessly' because they aren't treated as 'normal', yet he believes that gay men are ready to have families. how can you be reckless yet be ready for a family?..or rather, a good family?"
sarc,669,"i am really surprised you think that there are less than 500 incidents of people dying of second hand smoking. if you know that less about smoke, then i think we should stop right here. yet, you want to remove that right from all people, which i think is unreasonable and despotic. i want to remove the right from parents to destroy their children's lungs. thats what i'm trying to do. when do you think we have freedom? is it when alcohol, marijuana and whatever you can come up with is legalized without age limit? how is that freedom. how is it freedom to be forced to live in a smoke that kills you. i don't understand you people.. to become a free country, legalize everything. legalize murder, legalize robbery.. as long as you feel free, who cares about others?"
sarc,670,"i am well aware (and sympathetic) to your hatred of jews, negros, gays, gypsies, etc.; but i am shocked and dismayed at your ignorance (and/or) intolerance of hermaphrodites.  hitler; you sir, have lost my respect."
sarc,671,oh do go on. i am so impressed by your 'intellectuall' argument. pfft.
sarc,672,"of course it crossed my mind, but logic isn't allowed; this is religion. jesus isn't showing up or walking away from their bread munching wine drinking rituals. i am supposed to be surprised that jesus supposedly said just one more thing which makes no sense what so ever? the early church wasn't called catholic because there were no other protestants running around to differentiate between. if imagination alone could generate heaven, you would be right. i have no reason to believe heaven exists. which are based on the beliefs of the early church, which you have already admitted existed during jesus's life time."
sarc,673,"yes secular governments work. nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities, as pointed out by trebor, between a religion, such as christianity or islam and communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarism or a monarchy, but it does require an additional step, hence my comment of 2+2+2.  but just for kicks, let's say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea. this would be the only reason you can give, other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove, that makes the study flawed. which doesn't take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover. so take your time, think about it, because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it, but let's see if you can figure it out on your own."
sarc,674,i guess you failed that class. i am surprised that you passed any of your classes.. but i guess paper mills are paper mills.
sarc,675,"wrong again daewoo; but at least you are painfully consistent. i am merely pointing out the hypocrisy and level of ignorance obama displays every time he opens his economically clueless and divisive mouth. but then, who would ever accuse you of getting anything right? once again, the buffet rule is for the gullible and clueless to glom onto in a vacuum of reality and the fact that it would do nothing to solve this nations problems and is merely a diversion from the massive failure this president has been, more so than even carter.  i cant say i am surprised you would glom onto such an idiot talking point.  it is only strange for someone who is so completely clueless that they cannot even comprehend a simple thread premise.  so were you born this clueless, or deliberately play the role of someone who is patently clueless?"
sarc,676,"i support lower taxes fro the rich, the poor, and the middle class as well. in order to pull this off, you have to lower spending. this just isn;t going to happen with any of the current folks in power, nor will we likely be seeing any fresh faces that manage to pull off such a plan inthe future. that is a pretty impresive education you are working on (though it in no way makes you a shoe in for any political position). i am surprised you have come this far without somebody explaining to you that benifits of our current taxation system go far beyond having a police station or a highway on ramp next to your house. i guess maybe now that is a lesson they save for graduate school. they used to teach it in the 6th grade. sad."
sarc,677,"let us not forget that his 99% figure is most likely a load of horse dung in the first place. in fact, he's so full of **** that i am surprised the pressure build-up hasnt blown the top of his bloody head off."
sarc,678,"more from unkerpaulie's list: 'world net daily' is a 'medical/scientific institution'????????????????????? from the website: unbiased??????????????????? really, unkerpaulie, i am surprised you didn't list fred phelps website in your 'medical/scientific institutions' list."
sarc,679,"michele i am surprised you believe a politician, you must be mellowing in your old age........... eventually the 9th circuit will here the california issue.....oh and i know where the 9th circuit court is........."
sarc,680,"jyoshu, for someone who is so sure of his opinions, i am surprised that you have chosen to ignore my challenge to you statement - (btw, inseparable is spelt with an 'a'. :) ) leo"
sarc,681,"wow, i am surprised. no one told me vor had an illegitimate son. a real chip off the ol' block, same semi- coherent responses, same composition skills, same flag waving propensity, same absence of logical argument. i note that the double exclamation marks have replaced the period bursts but that may change following puberty. dono"
sarc,682,"why should anyone be swayed by facts, logic or reason? i am surprised to find out that it george w. bush was not responsible for these 'acts of terrorism' of the founding fathers. josef said http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism"
sarc,683,"i am really sorry and i have a confession. i dont read any of your stuff. i am surprised you dont know that by now! once again, my deepest apologies."
sarc,684,"i am surprised you dont use the phrase religious persecution because that is exactly what i am doing to do to you, right?"
sarc,685,what can you expect from someone that believes everything they have comes not from themselves but from some invisible being that actually does all the work. i am surprised that the creationist aren't saying everything that is is because their god created it though the people who have invented the products.
sarc,686,"although it later turned out that the use of the word 'their' may have been used in the plural, the use of the word in this post could well have been the singular. note i also high-lighted 'a person' (to which 'their' applied). so, i have nothing to be embarrassed about. i am surprised that you had never come across the use of the singular 'they/their/them'. it goes all the way back to chaucer's canterbury tales and whoso fyndeth hym out of swich blame, they wol come up [...] lewis and jane austin also used it. so, at least you managed to learn something today."
sarc,687,"iow, you don't have a clue. the usual nothing just a wag. i am surprised nato bit on a line like that? perhaps he thought you actually knew something emoticonxgood"
sarc,688,i am surprised scientists havn't made so much of a fuss about you. wow......
sarc,689,i am surprised that you were able to give a non troll answer.
sarc,690,"'wow my life my life is already turning out better then yours' what do you mean your life is turning out well? you live with your parents. you have no responsibilities, accomplishments, or qualifications for anything as you are 15. you are not even old enough to get a job, what are you talking about? ah i see you are related to jakej. i can't say i am surprised."
sarc,691,"wow, i am surprised you didn't say 'kill the retards.'"
sarc,692,"a: when it comes to civil rights, the'majority' does not rule!!!!!!!!!!! i suggest you 'float your boat' in the direction of the vatican city, as you have already proven that your first allegiance is to there, not to the usa of which you presume to be a citizen. emoticonxrolleyes  so what would you have us do? stand by silently while you promote the dogma of a sovereign foreign power (vatican city) to control the rights of us citizens? with your bigoted attitude, i am totally surprised yu are not advocating a constitutional ammendment to make the rcc the one, only, and required legal religion in the usa with the pope as chief executive. emoticonxrolleyes emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,693,you sound like such a great guy deliberately pissing off a person you call your friend. if that is what you call good works then i am truly impressed.
sarc,694,"so basically, what you are advocating here is that public schools should teach no moral values whatever. they shouldn't teach tolerance, because that offends the intolerant; they shouldn't teach racial equality, because that offends racists; they shouldn't teach religious freedom, because that offends religious bigots. maybe they shouldn't teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offends thieves and murderers.  i am truly surprised to hear a right-winger such as your good self advocating that public schools should promote a moral vacuum. but then, i suppose anything is better than teaching acceptance of gay families as just another sort of family among the many that exist today."
sarc,695,i am very impressed with your ability to copy and paste links. now what this proves about what you know about it is still unproven. unless you are the one in the videos giving the lectures...and he looks like he has been studying this longer then 'almost a decade'. nice try though. what proof can you give that is pertinent to the debate about how that disproves an eternal being? also you may want to get with some of the other atheists on the site because they were pushing the eternal universe and big bounce theories as explanations in other debates. you all should get your scientific consensus on the same page.
sarc,696,"which leaves us with? if you said 'an appeal to majority' you win teh prize! you're not really leaving it to them when you're talking about enacting legislation based on a theory which is still under debate. most doctors won't prescribe marijuana in this country either. i guess we should just leave that to them though, since they're more qualified."
sarc,697,i guess since your know how to post without the 50 characters you are a half veteran but once you figure out behind what's behind the humor of joe's post you will be a full veteran. pay attention.
sarc,698,"hey jesus, you were gone so long i was starting to wonder what happened to you. and now..., here you are, buried (-3 points as of now). i guess they're trying to crucify you again for your position. but i have faith in you. now go out there and show them that they can't keep a good man down!"
sarc,699,"i tried not to look like a tourist when i went to nyc last may, but i guess i gave it away with all of the pictures i was taking."
sarc,700,"oh..., well..., i guess that makes it ok then ;)"
sarc,701,"i guess, then, that you don't have a life? am i mistaken?"
sarc,702,"why thank you , and yes i guessed that as you are pretty busy grovelling to the hide and seek champ , so full credit to you and of course the invisible dictator ..., don be shy take a bow ....."
sarc,703,honestly did not know that acorn was such an evil organization that was based on evil-ness.  but really acorn seems like a very good organization based on helping those in need of help. i was under the impression of something totally different. i guess don't believe what you hear on fox news =]
sarc,704,"great depression? wow, you are drinking obama's kool aid. not really, it's an obvious fact to anyone not invested in corporate freedom. since our economic system is based on a profit loss system, profits are private and losses are not social. so if companies fail as did gm, they fail and not bail them out. i agree, let bad companies fail. oh wait, we can't, because the companies became so big that if they fail, our country will have massive unemployment and an industry vacuum. i guess letting companies grow so big wasn't a good idea? federal government has been bailing out companies and government since the 70's. one more sign that capitalism and the market aren't the magical cureall that you think."
sarc,705,i guess you missed the smiley. here it is again ;)
sarc,706,"as a side-note, i find it curious that the author of this debate proposes to test only on death row inmates and not the prison population generally. i guess she is only half crazy then. :)"
sarc,707,i just love how you attempt to be mr. forum police here steve. if you want to be a moderator so bad why not apply? i'm certain this board could use the help. as far as your scenario it's rather laughable but whatever. point being is if people demand evidence why not give them that? i'd rather be an open honest man than hide behind a handle any day.
sarc,708,"ah yes, i just love it when evangalists show just how christian they are. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,709,"i love how you claim that the teabag party is not affiliated with the republicans, who are they going to vote with ?.. the democrats?.. they may not claim to be republicans but last i checked we only have two major parties representing us in the house and senate, with maybe one or two independents.the tea bag party isn't big enough to control anything without republicans so enlighten me, who are they going to vote with to destroy what obama has accomplished so far?..."
sarc,710,"i love how bitm can start all these new threads that ironically, say the same thing over and over, yet somehow when pressed to backup his own policy positions he continually flees the threads. we're still waiting on you bitm..."
sarc,711,"i love how the government has become the scapegoat for the failure of parents to control their kids, and in turn we are losing more and more civil liberties..."
sarc,712,"i love how you speak for all christians when you say that. 'as a racist, i believe that black people...' society has a compelling interest in, if not exposing people to differing cultures, lifestyles etc., then at least in not going out of its way to hide them. if homosexuals are so wrong, then the children will figure that out on their own without government prodding."
sarc,713,i love how marc is just detached from reality. i doubt he'll reply to how he's so wrong about the cases he listed. two can't even be found on findlaw.
sarc,714,"i love how iranian president alphabets kidnaps 15 sailors and marines, holds them captive on bs evidence, and then trys to act like the biggest humanitarian on earth by 'pardoning' them out of the kindness of his heart. personally, i think it would be nice for these 15 british troops to see the bombers going the opposite direction as they leave iranian airspace."
sarc,715,"i love how gun prohibitionists say they want to stop guns getting into the hands of criminals, but they are quite happy for guns to be in the hands of the biggest criminal of all, the government - warmongerer, mass murderer, tyrant and violent thief."
sarc,716,"i love how the rightie wingnuts think that obama is a socialist muslim when their own mentally defective vp nominee is a practicing member of the pentacostal church, and a creationist. at least obama's head is screwed on properly."
sarc,717,"i love how you are pro-choice until its a choice you don't like. let people carry guns in their own home. let them carry it on their person. it has nothing to do with you does it not? unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it doesn't. their house =/= their choice, her body = her choice?  i love hypocrisy."
sarc,718,"i love how you voted true and then tried to challenge the idea. priceless! this is not exactly the same as any of my other debates at all - and this is not about assigning labels. but since you raise the issue, as labels go, the word 'fetus' is the label and 'child' is what the child actually is.  the word fetus is just a label used to mark the stage of life and development that the animal (in this case a human being) is in.  you can see by the comments so far.... it's still a very difficult thing to get pro-aborts to accept."
sarc,719,"i love how many of the far rights love to say they're independant because they disagree with like maybe one republican issue, or because they have a general mistrust of government... yet on every issue (besides maybe the one) and every vote they are lock and step with the conservatives. michael savage is a far right conservative commentator. that's what he is. you can tell because all of his listeners are far right conservatives, or independants who fit into the category i described above. and you can also tell because he falls on either the conservative side of every single issue, or even further right of the conservative side of every issue. while i'm sure it helps sane conservatives sleep at night to think that hate-mongering lunatic isn't of their ilk, i'm afraid it just isn't true."
sarc,720,"i love how you christian apologists repel in horror when you hear about muslim or jewish atrocities, and yet you don't even flinch when someone talks about the rape, murder, genocide, lying, deceit and homophobia committed by your god.  the spanish inquisition was an attempt to maintain catholic indoctrination through violence. you clearly feel asleep in history class. didn't do your homework, did you? i'm not going to deny that people have been influenced positively by christianity, but it's ludicrous to suggest that no bad things have come out of it. ever heard of a little something called to holocaust?"
sarc,721,"lol, i love how everyone seems to feel the need to out-wit rk even after over 50 days xd"
sarc,722,"i love how you ignore all logic, reason, morality, and all rationality. how can you say my arguments are wrong if you will not go through piece by piece and dispute me? if im so wrong, why do you just say that and not actually show that i am wrong.  you hope that one day ill be capable of rational thought? coming from the guy who believes in a magic sky daddy from a fairytale book. oh how silly of me to reject something that i have yet to find any shred of significant evidence for. oh what a fool ive been"
sarc,723,"loll i love how you completely ignore the link i posted ehh?? and then you downvoted me and tried to sound smart afterwards, but actually made yourself look like twice a fool. :d. you better upvote me again. smh. hah."
sarc,724,"also i love how you presume to know how i spend my time. you know i should use my skills as an rn to volunteer at clinics, or help out at places such as the red cross, my local domestic violence shelter, food pantry, fire department, or mission. oh wait i already do those things...with my friends. but i'm sure you already knew that."
sarc,725,"i love how you are using violence to threaten people. when, your argument is disputing violence."
sarc,726,i love how you point out the obvious . like what's already been implied in the statement. lol.
sarc,727,i love how you cons cry race card when someone points out obvious racism.
sarc,728,i love how you're pretending to not know your way around the 50 character minimum... that's cute.
sarc,729,"i love how what you 'personally' feel is in direct conflict with acedemic studies. science says force = mass times acceleration, but i personally feel that force = velocity times volume, so that must be the right answer."
sarc,730,"i love how you came right in talking about gods, but i feel content in dc's god power over marvel's."
sarc,731,i love how you completely ignored the part about your fake account. lol! you so crazy ra!
sarc,732,"i love how your sources never support your point. well, i wasn't able to find out about the rebellions of christianity from your source, but it did show some positive points, so i guess that was good."
sarc,733,"i love how you think atheism is evil when you worship a vengeful god full of hatred, according to your own religious text."
sarc,734,"i love how you cling to hope that your god exists. dont you think its about time to stop the denials and face the facts? you actually believe that god has no time to help all of the starving people,  indeed. christianity are a fool for thinking that god is a good person"
sarc,735,i love how you managed to advocate reading the bible all the while pile slamming insults on it. pure brilliance. :d
sarc,736,"i love how the athesists respond, they claim to not debate thesists, but they follow debate religion like it's their religion. we (this writer) has never professed not to debate theists. this is a debating society. there are theists within it. therefore no illusion can be made that atheists do not herein debate theists."
sarc,737,and i love it how you attempt to once again change the subject when you have been proven wrong and have nothing more to support your position. can you stay on topic and reply to my previous rebuttal of your nonsense?..
sarc,738,i love it how no mention of bush can go long without the word nazi! emoticonxrolleyes
sarc,739,"i love it how you every time someone disagrees with you, you call it 'attacking' :|"
sarc,740,"i love it when straight homophobes tell us what it is to be gay. i am a woman, maybe i should tell all the fellas that it really don't get hurt when they get kicked in the balls. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,741,"i love it when 'heathens' try to tell me what my religion does or doesn't do. emoticonxrolleyes  ah yes, here come the personal attacks. duo must be getting desperate again."
sarc,742,"i love it when you left wingers put president bush's intelligence down......you forget that he had a higher gpa at yale then kerry did......... the president is dumb like a fox..........he beat you in 2000, beat you in 2002, beat you worse in 2004..... if he is dumb, what does that make you lefties?"
sarc,743,"i love it when people do this. 'you have to prove everything you say, but i'm allowed to simply make assertions and it's your job to show i'm wrong.'"
sarc,744,"i love it when hypocrites say that we are no longer old testament law but proceed to quote the old testament that they just dismissed making themselves out to be fools and hypocrites. you can not have it both ways. either the old testament applies, or it does not. also, do you play football, wear polyester, stuff like that? those are abominations too. for more abominations, read leviticus 11. damn, this is a jolly good time!"
sarc,745,"i love it when you make the 'flat earth' argument! i suppose the same goes for the 600 scientists who recently signed a petition voicing their disagreement with the ipcc's alarmist conclusions and even showed up at the recent kioto 2 conference to protest and try to get their voices heard. 2 of them are nobel award winning scientists.  before you make the typical argument that they are all secretly working for oil co's, the same could be said about those scientists that support the man made gw argument, after all, that's how they get funding for their research, scare the daylights out of the politicos and enough of their constituents and they throw endless amounts of funding your way."
sarc,746,i love when differing from someones opinion is 'weak'. such a convincing argument.
sarc,747,i so love it when you have to work so hard to avoid any points i made. i take it as assent to my original post.
sarc,748,i still love it how ethmi thinks that defaulting on our massive debt is less important then obama's dubious ties to dubious people.  what a tool. or maybe he didn't realize that the poll was public? emoticonxbye
sarc,749,i totes love how your arguments doesn't even tell us what your answer is since you laughed a question that had two sides open for agreement or disagreement.
sarc,750,he is. it is like i sin a few times now i am a satanist. i was not aware that i could not have an opinon without being a satanist. you have been a christian longer: does god hate lying lips?
sarc,751,"ah, the ignorent american consumer/cattle has something to tell a philosopher... 'get a life' what is that, some sort of slogan for a new weight-loss product? ha, 'get a life'. who cares about real issues, right? instead let's all go to wal mart and look for cool new stuffs and then eat some mcdonalds and complain about nascar and how people are always so this and that... and let's go see die hard 4 in theaters, and let's talk on our cellphones about what we always talk over and over again to all of our myfavs and let's watch fox news and the o'reilly factor, and listen to how our father 'george w' is saving the world from all those 'ignant' terrorist who just hate us because we are free...  yeah, a philosopher would like you to think that he is boring."
sarc,752,yes let's all cheer on the glorified shameless point-farming bitch of this site.
sarc,753,"much of the land you propose that people should just move to is uninhabitable. yeah, let's all go live in deserts and mountains. let's build cities, schools, and factories on the sides of mountains and in grasslands where resources are low to continue living our industrialized lives."
sarc,754,"let's all listen to one religious book and base our laws off of that, regardless of any other beliefs that may exist, especially when regarding something that has little to no effect on anyone but those directly involved. that makes sense."
sarc,755,"wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. finally you are cheering for the correct side. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again. it is funny how many of you religious people are so sure of your faith, but can't stand to see other people talk about how observable data doesn't fit with it."
sarc,756,"see you know, lets all sign a petition to ban the doctor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you know prodigee was right all along!"
sarc,757,"fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. there has to be an order to things if not there will be chaos, history has proven this time and time again, but if you think that's the way to live be my guest, you will not live to long, the universe seeks balance and order not chaos. yes power will corrupt this is the reason for the system we have, like family, town, state, government and un to prevent the power hungry from taking over, it is up to us to prevent that from happening, we the people are the world not some lone wolf."
sarc,758,"fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. that is you doing the same damn thing, hypocrite."
sarc,759,"jesus has always existed, he is god, and god has existed before all man or anything at all. alexander the not-so-great must have have been one of the biggest std spreaders in history than!!! lets all praise him for the great things he has done like spreading stds!!!"
sarc,760,"let's all listen to one religious book and base our laws off of that, regardless of any other beliefs that may exist, especially when regarding something that has little to no effect on anyone but those directly involved. that makes sense. lets all listen to one scientific theory and base our laws to teach that the earth is round. that doesn't make sense"
sarc,761,oh really? anybody can say that they are a always a guest on here and then all of a sudden come . nice try for an excuse.
sarc,762,"oh really? then please provide me with several links that prove i'm an idiot or shut the fuck up! considering you only have 30 points i'm not too sure just how much you could possible know about anyone on this site? come on dude! you're a troll and everyone knows it... stop your trolling, grow up and hang with the big dogs... if you can't then close your fucking troll account and go bye bye."
sarc,763,"oh really, this is a debate site? then wouldn't you agree that members should debate as opposed to belittle and mock? forgive me if i'm mistaken, but there's a difference between simply disagreeing with something, and hating something."
sarc,764,"oh really? lots of people would object to sitting around doing nothing in school? really? last i checked students are always complaining and would much rather do nothing in class, than learn. and with meditation, it would help tremendously, reduce stress, help creativity, spur imagination, stay focused, learn to love, less bullying, better eating, better health, better everything..."
sarc,765,"oh really? ever voluntarily flown in a plane by any chance? taken medication for anything, or received a vaccination?"
sarc,766,oh really? where might i see this cowboy? might i have some evidence to support your appalling claims? pick any cowboy movie .. any
sarc,767,"oh really? people were born gay? that's insane....don't drag god into your crazy notions of homosexual genetics... you have no proof....'therefore, since he also allowed other animal species to be born gay' its funny how would use unreasoning animals to justify homosexual behavior... i guess if everyone did stuff like that most of us would have multiple sexual partners(male lions),we would be murderers, thieves, rapists, and pedophiles just because animals engage in these behaviors...."
sarc,768,"oh really? is that apparently so? i don't believe that. allow me to show you error in your beliefs. god knows everything,correct?"
sarc,769,774 billion to china in debt... where are you going to 'buy' new technology? oh right... from china.
sarc,770,i was not trying to convince anyone. so what the hell is your point man? oh right there is no point. you are just trying to be an uncouth lout.
sarc,771,"did you really post that shitty argument? do something else with your brain.. oh right, you're incapable of it. xoxo"
sarc,772,"atheists believe in god.... they just don't want to believe in god because they are in rebellion to god maybe in your mind, because you can't see a world without god. a parallel is that of a parent and child. so atheists are naughty children? and he or she then rebells to the point of extreme anger. atheists are extremely angry? oh right, like those atheist terrorists, or the atheists that campaign at the funerals of dead soldiers. atheists are just angry at god for no real reason care to prove this?"
sarc,773,"nor do i understand how buying materialistic items or receiving them is very christian yes!!! thankyou!!! i'm glad someone finally said it! now what was one of the deadly sins of christianity? oh right, greed. hypocrisy much?"
sarc,774,"accountable by trial? by following the advice given to them? when people screw up, they are culpable for trial. how about holding the advisors accountable? oh wait!! how about holding the people who put the advisors in power accountable? oh shit!!! hold the government accountable! hold the people who put government accountable. hold every citizen accountable. when you're done acting hysterical, let's get back on topic. nice work, captain hindsight. you put yourself at trial. 'i shouldn't have acted like i know more about drilling for oil than oil companies'. apparently you are easily influenced by television. to recap: when an oil company screws up by cost-cutting, which leads to a major environmental disaster and the loss of eleven lives, we hold them accountable by trial. committees like the one which found bp et al culpable are instrumental in building a case against bp."
sarc,775,"who says there is an afterlife? oh wait, people from two thousand years ago before science. hmmm."
sarc,776,"if god is supposed to be omnibenevolent, why should we fear him? oh wait, he kills children..."
sarc,777,"isn't that amazing that you were the fool all along? oh wait, you are to simple-minded to understand that. carry on."
sarc,778,"ignoring the fact that the wealth of the 1% comes from the labor of the other 99%. try running a multi-billion dollar business without any workers, and see how that works out. if the workers are better, why don't they start a new business to compete against them? oh wait, they can't, this is not free market capitalism, this is crony capitalism, which is supplied by the very people whom you fervently trust, the cronies in government."
sarc,779,"what are they doing at the marshals service anyway besides losing two way radios? maybe, they should just radio it in to find them, oh wait, they can't, they are lost."
sarc,780,"my debate. i say when we're done. another childish response. you from britain? oh wait of course you are, you're mic."
sarc,781,your face is always red??? oh wait! your real face.... hehe
sarc,782,"hmmm? why would you say that? it makes no sense.. competition is what pays the bills... oh wait... i know, you want to receive the sickest bastard on cd award! i hope you aren't being a pedophile again?"
sarc,783,"yes..but what is the difference between killing for fun and killing by mistake???? you drive your big suv to work every day...how many animals do you accidently kill? how many insects? oh wait, you judge a life by how big the life is...ignorant humans!"
sarc,784,"be homophobic... like the naacp? oh wait, they're left wing. call for war... like the democrats for vietnam? oh wait, they're left wing. be racist... like claim that minorities can't help themselves? oh wait, that's also left wing. sir... you've engaged in stereotyping... that makes you... hmm."
sarc,785,"so tell me what was his most prudent action during the first term.... was it going into iraq? or maybe giving huge tax cuts to the rich and blowing the budget surplus?  oh wait, i know! it was pulling out of the kyoto treaty, alienating foreign countries, and asking congress to pass the patriot act! no, no... it has to be when he found out about 9/11 and did absolutely nothing for like ten minutes.  i hope you sense the sarcasm. bush didn't do a good job in his first term. and he didn't do well in his second either."
sarc,786,do you believe there is a god? i answered the question.... i don't see where it asked for anything other than my opinion. are you seeing things that aren't there? oh wait... look who i'm talking to.
sarc,787,depends do you put any thought into writing your arguments? oh wait you don't never mind.
sarc,788,good thing this argument has never been done!...oh wait. With that logic we should make everything legal. You are much better off making theft legal and safe (no more guns needed!) than to have it illegal and dangerous. 
sarc,789,"Wow BIOLOGISTS have been working on strteches of DNA of previously unknown function and found what they went looking for - function. That sure knocks genetics and evolution off its feet. Yep no question about it at all. Darwin will be trashed when junk DNA is explained, all his predictions about junk DNA being functionless will be falsified. Oh, oh wait a second. Darwins theory and the NDS make zero predictions about ""junk"" DNA! Guess that if one has nothing to falsify then falsification is pretty unlikely. "
sarc,790,You know what I find amusing here...your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet. Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted. That is the true christian-American spirit isn't it? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now...oh wait...most of them owned people...nevermind. 
sarc,791,"oh yeah, 'cos that bible you have is so much more moral than songs that swear! :)"
sarc,792,"QUOTE  oh yeah god is the root of all evil! tell that to the person who was about to murder their spouse for cheating but refrained from doing so because they believe that god is watching.END QUOTE how about that damn evil mother theresa too  now why would someone murder an adulteress in the first place? oh, right! the bible punishes adultery with death. mother teresa was no longer faithful at the time of her death. she realised the lack of voice of jesus, the lack of presense."
sarc,793,"FILTER BY LACK OF ENGLISH WORDS. oh yeah..???????? emotion is juz lyk the engine vch pulls da coaches n help'em 2 reach 2 der destinantion as da coaches've no destination 2 move or 2 b pulled....da same way, if der's no emotion how da hell man can accomplish his goal nd destination......my dear competent frnd.....most probably u've forgotten da 'v r human beings'."
sarc,794,"oh yeah because the septics on this site are so much better!! anyway i dont think brits are desparate to reclaim lost glory, if their proud of the country their proud it's just that, there's no way britain could become the superpower it once was and i dont think it would help the country anyway. if by lost glory people mean sport then of course they are the same as any other country gets behind its national team but that is rarely britain except for the olympics otherwise its england, scotland, ireland and wales normally play as separate countries (eg the football)"
sarc,795,"violence, death, conflict, etc. yet god is the one who condones all that. in fact who considers most of it right. BEGIN QUOTE he doesn't care about what's right and not right. END QUOTE oh yeah, god really does not care about those at all. considering all that he regards as good (slavery, raping, killing children, etc.) BEGIN QUOTE he has no remorse for his actions.END QUOTE  it just gets better and better... BEGIN QUOTE sure, you don't have to worship him,  END QUOTE only an idiot would worship god. BEGIN QUOTE but i don't think he encourages people to grow and live their life the 'moral' way. END QUOTE this is so true. god is not moral, not even remotely close."
sarc,796,"can ukraine and belarus come back i miss the motherland, oh yeah i cannot agree more!!!"
sarc,797,"oh yeah of course you will, and while your at it you will be a genocidal dictator and people will still love your god damn country instead of wanting to change it back! lol very funny!"
sarc,798,"oh yeah! obama really rocks! he really deserved this.!!!ok, so, obama, deserves this. let's go obama let's go!"
sarc,799,"oh yeah i forgot, the government is out to get you. okay, carry on with your crazy ass. that is absolutely absurd, get fucking real, i just don't trust them. government only cares about one thing, destroying liberties and gaining power! 'the government needs to be exposed because it cannot be trusted to expose itself, the light of day and the light of truth are the best disinfectants for the government.' lies"
sarc,800,"oh yeah, i almost forgot... what about all the plants, weeds, trees that were under water? many of them wouldn't be able to survive, like cacti, so did ole noah have to bring all that stuff along too? man! i hope that boat was big."
sarc,801,"oh yeah, it's a real brain teaser. who would have thought it's possible for someone to have two parents?"
sarc,802,"oh yeah, all the most famous scientists, composers, writers, bands. all girls of course.... no, not really. yeah whitney huston, obviously way bigger than the rolling stones, beatles, who, led zeplin...... yeah great. take a step back, and read some good literature, you might learn something, un biased. opera the most powerful woman on earth> if she is, why will she die in the next 30-40 years, and how come i had never even heard of her until a little while back? how come, if she is so powerful, she is not out curing terminal diseases. oh i guess sitting on some leather sofa trying to get more ratings is way better!"
sarc,803,"oh yeah, they made all that stuff up for people who believe in that ;)"
sarc,804,oh yeah because someone else getting involved and helping them wage war on palestine for daring to live in their own country is really likely to prevent the war from escalating.
sarc,805,"oh yeah, that's right.... i forgot ;) i'm getting dementia already ;) well, i guess that if i don't make it to heaven (due to all the liberals i've tormented over the years) i'll be so busy shaking hands with all of my friends that i wont have time to worry ;)"
sarc,806,"reproduction oh yeah, because our 7 billion high population, with estimates for 10 billion by the end of the century, really needs to force gay people to do it. if the person is religious in the christian religion, it only damns those who sleep with another man as he does a women. your sexual orientation itself is not bad. and anyway, it's their own problem, love the sinner, hate the sin, as jesus said. i'm not sure about other religions specific text against gays. if he wants to. i talked about how people shouldn't be forced to, i said that some people could."
sarc,807,you're fucking kidding me right? you do realize no matter which one of us is right it's still fucked up right?  god flat out blatantly allowed satan to torment job and kill people.  and you justify that by saying he was given a new family?! oh yeah they gave him a new wife and new kids that makes it allllllll better. just replace those god allowed to be killed for some stupid test. fucking christians and their fucked up twisted morality.
sarc,808,"yes there is life after death because in hell there will be weeping,screaming,and gnashing of teeth because people are suffering because they choose not to believe in god and just how srom1883 said that its not god that sends people to hell its the the person who decides not to believe in god and do it there own way when there is only one way to heaven and thats through jesus christ alone. oh yeah, great. care to back that up with some hard evidence? (fairy tale books don't count, sorry)."
sarc,809,your comparing us to animals? that is really sad man. most animals? so their are animals that in your opinion are....cooler then us? what the heck does cooler mean anyways? oh yeah knowledege led us to a better future...... oh look we have nuclear warfare! so much better! oh look we have weapons that can wipe out this whole planet and bring us into an ice age! dude thats so freakin awsume! oh yeah were learning from our mistakes alright! hey werent we supposed to pull out of this freakin war in the middle east! but nooooooo we are launching missiles on libia thats solves alot..... because we gained so much knowledge and learned from our mistakes! if you pay attention to what is really going on and open your eyes to the cruel reality of human nature you would understand how desperate we are in need of a savior.
sarc,810,oh yeah so our tax dollars pay for there asses to live in our prisons? no thanks our tax dollars are the ones feeding and bedding there asses
sarc,811,oh yeah. way easier. which is why gay marriage has come such a long way since it started. ;) marriage would only be removed from any legal document. it will still appear in religious documents. the compromise will be a hell of a lot more amicable than the tension that currently exists.
sarc,812,"islamic countries have extremely sexist laws against women in an islamic country a women can be put to death for any of the following offenses walking without a male escort, driving, being raped, using the bathroom without permission, being seen in public with a man other than her husband, getting an education, or even having a job, don't believe me look up sharea law i may have misspelled that but whoopty fucken do. also the middle east is a hot bed for violent muslim extremists. hmm i wonder ware the hot bed for violent christian extremists is? oh yeah that's right nowhere."
sarc,813,"oh yeah, but its okay to say that george bush is a criminal is it? no one wants to be fair then do they, lets be fair only when a democrat gets in trouble!"
sarc,814,"oh yeah, there's a whole section of the country (the grain belt or maybe the midwest) that eats these things 2 or 3 times a day. sometimes even for desert.... ...okay i was kidding about that last part, but still."
sarc,815,"i just told you how. if you want to change your gender, then go ahead... but comparing it to changing clothes is just idiotic.  oh yeah! i forgot, you already think the entire human race is stupid... so i guess you have an excuse."
sarc,816,"oh yeah i remember reading that if gay people got married heterosexuals would end up loving each other less!!! anyway the overall meaning of marriage was destroyed the moment religous people started getting divorced, if the church no longer frowns upon man splitting that which god has joined together then has the overall message of marriage not been destroyed already?"
sarc,817,"oh yeah, because kids can't tell the difference between a video game and real life, they'll pick it up, shoot their family and things its a game, right?"
sarc,818,yes there it is the word that is favorited by the liberals!!! biiiiiiigot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh yeah!!!!!!!! it's not a sin to be temped but you don't need to fall into your temptation and do what is tempting you. and yes you are demon possessed.
sarc,819,"oh yeah? you can't out-post me! i type about 20 wpm. i still look at the keyboard when i type... which means, ultra-focus! i can switch between my right index finger and my left index finger. i'm a posting machine... try me."
sarc,820,"'they give both sides of the isle a chance to talk.' oh yeah, us liberals are free to talk on fox...  we just aren't allowed to defend ourselves when our statements are taken out of context, correct you when you misquote or misread soemthing for the benefit of your stance on a topic, or have the last word.... other than that, we may speak...."
sarc,821,"oh yeah, you got me. bigotry and hate are major turn on for me. you could use a good lay anyway. muah. ;0"
sarc,822,oh yeah i forgot! you hated on me a couple of times before! thanks for the reminder. ;)
sarc,823,"no. go back 6 million years ago ... oh yeah! i forgot that you lived back then... okay, but all joking aside, we can't really know. however, if the bible is correct, then they did believe in god. you know, 'cause he directly spoke to them."
sarc,824,"lmao seriously i rarely show emotion, but that's funny. 1. how does that compare to 9/11 exactly? 2. at least that guy was aprehended, where's osama again? oh yeah that's right, we were busy in a random country in the mid-east because some president's daddy was there and jr wanted to show how cool he was. bush should have stuck to bankrupting professional baseball teams and oil companies. and conservatives have no leg left to stand on... literally your pirate avatar is fitting as insulting as you would wish it were. take out your peg leg and try to stand on an issue. current republicans = bought and owned by private interest. those sad soles defending it = easily persuaded and uneducated. i know because i'm an elite liberal. i regularly laugh at how dumb you are."
sarc,825,"ever hear of an insurance company? you know, that thing that you voluntarily pay for so that if you get hurt there is money available? oh yeah, i forgot, you're a socialist so anything private is evil and greedy and government is a magical thing. ps: at the end of the day, i still know how to run my life better than you do, so keep your nose out of it."
sarc,826,"oh yeah..., how long does it take to walk from one end of the country to the other? ;)"
sarc,827,"oh yeah..., have a big burly homosexual with a raging hard-on coming fast towards a little naked skinny dude.... i'll bet you the little naked skinny dude will run ;)"
sarc,828,"plus i think it is great for all the orphans in need of new homes. oh yeah, that's awesome! i would love to leave an orphanage to meet my two new dads!"
sarc,829,oh yeah? tell that to the next person you see running down the street wielding a knife. ;)
sarc,830,"and just how the hell is a dog going to decide, 'oh yeah, it's just gorgeous, i think i'll wear it to the ball this evening...'?"
sarc,831,"oh yeah, i totally bought adobe photoshop too. i definitely did not illegally download it, because that would be wrong. ;)"
sarc,832,"oh yeah man, i'm feeling the love, everything is one and i'm one with everything, there are no distinctions, reality is just an illusion right? what do you call someone who is out of touch with reality?"
sarc,833,"do you know what a marriage is under the law? oh yeah, that's right, a legal union. they are the exact same thing just with different names, its like if i had two identical roses and called them joe and sam, they're still both the same rose."
sarc,834,"oh yeah..., my fiends did that for me. they had an intervention and they vented. they were pissed me for mercilessly trolling them and it worked. i am now a kinder, gentler, troll ;)"
sarc,835,"it's the same kind of remark you made to sandy. what is the matter, you can dish it out but you can't take it? oh yes.. i forgot. all the wives you ever had divorced you. never mind."
sarc,836,oh no you didn't! not g earnst website?  oh yes you did! that would be like me quoting from nato's website.  po tow mack institute emoticonxsmilie  potomac river humm.
sarc,837,"oh yes... and there also needs to be a loaded gun with a single bullet in the chamber there sitting next to their huge book of lies... so that when this poor xxxxx finally despairs they can at least have an easy way out... your an idiot plain and simple. i dare you to talk to the mothers of those young teens that took there own lives cause of their sexuality and see what they have to say.... regret, pain, and suffering because they were too blind to see past their bible...."
sarc,838,"oh yes, the flood that left no trace of ever occuring. gotta fear the threat of nothing! i'm so afraid of a flood that never happened!  as for sodom, well, i practice good hospitality. i don't know about you. you know, god isn't going to be happy when you keep limiting its power by calling it a 'he' all the time. god is limitless, it has no gender."
sarc,839,oh yes. the holocaust never happened and the nazis were innocent aryan wonder-men. =d :)
sarc,840,"oh yes...because mainstream science is concocting one big hoax just to brainwash you. it's a conspiracy of rabid scientists. emoticonxrolleyes we all know you know much more that scientific peer reviewed journals and the scientific method, right? you're scientific credentials?"
sarc,841,"oh yes, that time when you were on two ships at the same time in different oceans? or how about when you were a mid level naval officer who suddenly became a high level army advisor to the south vietnamese?  you're lying."
sarc,842,"huh. explain why you call people bush haters and use personal attacks yourself when you're running out of ammo? oh yes, it's because you're a hypocrite. i'm voice of treason, i can call people all the horrible names i want, but the minute they say one bad thing about me, i whine like a little girl about how it;'s so unfair and how they are meanies!"
sarc,843,oh yes.  and people say the vatican is dealing with pedophilia molestation by glorifying one of the worst offenders in recorded history. :p
sarc,844,"oh yes, i amsure one read of your posts and every gay man will go ex-agy {/sarcasm]"
sarc,845,"define 'real.'  please, how are those all conservative?  national security is a part of both. low taxes? since when was low taxes conservative? oh yes never. reform ss? that's no conservative either. conserativism dictates that we kill the thing. tort reform? when was that ever a part? small business, since when were republicans for small business when they are subsidizing large corporations who have a history of buying out, running out of town and shutting down small business."
sarc,846,"that wasn't a reason why we fought hitler. in fact, if you will remember many in the states didn't believe that occured until they saw the pictures.  hardly a reason to invade. unless you'd like to flip it around and say that every country who's leader we tried to murder has the same right. emoticonxrolleyes  how is that our problem? oh yes, it's not.  as i recall, we kicked him out, beat him up, put him under sanctions and virtually removed any ability to do anything of revelance.  doesn't that mean we have to invade north korea? emoticonxrolleyes  that's been dealt with already. rehashed arguments are worthless.  huh. stalinist govermemnt. reminds me of the dictators the us put in power in latin america. :) the mass graves also was dealt with. but then again, you clearly do not understand the me culture."
sarc,847,"why? that doesn't make alot of sense. we say gas go over $2 during a period of relatively low demand. why would gas stabalize that a price that is lower then what it was during a period of low demand when high demand is projected with increases consumption in china the us and the industralized world as a whole? oh yes, i'm asking the person who thinks that cds are good investments during periods of low inflation. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,848,"oh yes liberal: anyone who disagrees with vor regardless of their political standing. you would call frist a liberal if he disagreed with you, hell you would even goldwater a liberal if he disagreed with you.  i'm going to mentally replace farfignewgin whenever you say liberal, after all, they have the same meaning in your context.  you can support the troops by disagreeing with any mission that is unncessary in terms of security and any mission that puts troops in unncessary danger. explain to me how you can support the troops by supporting a mission that doesn't help america and gets 1600 of them needlessly killed."
sarc,849,"uh...how does that work? oh yes, comming from the person who thinks a cd is good during times of low inflation, it does not suprise me you do not even understand the basics of taxation."
sarc,850,"oh yes... when someone disagrees with you, bring on the irrelavent rhetoric."
sarc,851,oh yes and i canyt read books ask questions. so i know nothing about how saddam was ' no threat' well he was a few years ago. now hes not cuz we found the coward in a hole.
sarc,852,"oh yes. that's why the brits took fast and sure measures to round up the islamofascist jerks. wish we could do the same here, oh yes, i almost forgot.we are!!"
sarc,853,"oh yes, the kkk, that 'rightous' chrisitan orignization. it is stil quite active in the south, particularly in many of the bible belt states, and east texas"
sarc,854,"i assume you are christian? do you follow everything in the bible? i guess you better get stoning of your neighbors going then for working on sunday and wearing blended fabric. oh yes i do take offense that you want to kill gay people since you believe that you can't ignor some parts of the bible. you are then comanded to kill gay people, prostitutes, and smartmouthed children."
sarc,855,oh yes...i masquerade as an atheist and a 6-day creationist at the same time to try to appeal to a wider audience.
sarc,856,"i do like written constitutions very much; and our constitution is not vague at all. in the first amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is 'the freedom of the press?' this phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. you have gathered incorrectly, for i do not want a direct democracy. how do you suppose we got 'civil rights' recognized in the constitution to begin with, matthew? did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. darn evil democracy! i say down with majority rule!"
sarc,857,"oh yes matt, i'm just an angry little ogre who can't stand to think that gays might find happiness in this lifetime, [sarcasm]. get a clue matthew, i have no personal investment at all regarding your life or your lifestyle. all i'm doing is sharing the spiritual truths that you hate to hear or consider. don't blame me because you live a life of delusions and self deception, because that is the life you are living. and none of those so called good people who encourage and show tolerance for your chosen lifestyle are your friends at all. and yet you prefer their lies to my truth. go figure huh?"
sarc,858,oh yes those horrible wicked gays that will distroy families and consume morality as we know it.
sarc,859,and neither did god write them. they were writen by men and there was no devine inspiration. there is no difference between the bible and margaret mitchell's gone with the wind. oh yes i am sorry gone with the wind at least gets history correct.
sarc,860,"oh yes, and nobody in the history of the universe has ever been killed by anything besides a gun. for that matter, there aren't many nuts with guns around here. the thing is that the media won't make money if it says 'kid walks grandma safely across street'. what will bring in the bucks is 'kid walks grandma halfway across street, pushes her in front of semi-truck, and eats the remains'."
sarc,861,"oh yes. it is much safer for conservatives to just go on o'reilly's show or interview with fox news. heaven forbid they ever be challenged on their views, cause they just may start thinking about knocking teeth loose instead of answering real questions with real answers ... emoticonxwow < end sarcasm > huckabee has been on stewart's show multiple times before. he'll be back. he isn't afraid to be challenged. stewart's nowhere near as bad as you make him out to be. the extremists get annoyed with stewart, but i think the main problem they have is not regarding a lack of civility, but rather cause he shines a light on the cockroaches and rust in the conservative thinking process. what did stewart say that was actually lacking in civility or warranting 'teeth' loosening? does huckabee even have a show?"
sarc,862,"oh yes, christians are the people who strive to lose their virginity before marriage...not really. you will most likely hear more about christian people losing their virginity because it is more out of the ordinary (or the people are nominal christians) for example, the news broadcasts nearly every plane crash, but there are far more car accidents. i find it humorous that so many leftists try to label the right as racist or discriminatory in some way, and then comments like that are made. its all very hypocritical."
sarc,863,"oh yes that was very enlightening, could i get the stick drawing anyway?"
sarc,864,"oh yes we do think so. as you know very well where that figure came from.  the latest study at harvard. new study finds 45,000 deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage | harvardscience interesting, isn't it, how our side is always quoting figures from harvard and such, and all your ilk can dig up is 'townhall' and hannity's second grade collages."
sarc,865,"compared to speaking all that is into existence, these events were childs-play for my father in heaven. these are much easier to believe/accept than your magic of the big bang event spontaneously occurring with no trigger or determinable origin. then the spontaneous appearance of life on earth from that puddle of primordial ooze. oh yes snakepit, as easy pointed out so poignantly, that's not believing in magic, is it!!!"
sarc,866,reckon if a rock could think it would have a concept or two.
sarc,867,"that's me, and proud of it. but i guess you get your jollies when pagan religious symbols or a pagan religious event can be displayed / practiced, but to heck with anything that might resemble christianity? real nice and equitable there, moose.  it got me a lot of 'excellent!' and 'way to go!' remarks from a number of co-workers.  bull. i've seen it, though it's been many decades now. get real. halloween itself is a pagan religious event, if you will do some research for a change. once again, pagan-related religious themes are fine, but screw the christians.  aren't you one of the libs who tries to sell their 'tolerance' (except for anything christian)? reckon so."
sarc,868,"reckon you'll be eating your own words in due time, moose.  not from what i've seen so far in your posts. keep plugging, though, you may find god yet when you run out of all those ill-conceived arguments against him."
sarc,869,"there it is, at the top in bold letters. reckon you can find it now?"
sarc,870,"oh, how about the other states charge a special fee to inspect anything imported from kalifornia? seems like there was a little trade war going on over oj from florida and texas once and kalifornia lost.  what does the constitution of the u.s. say about powers prohibited to the states? reckon kalifornia is bound by the u.s. constitution? emoticonxagree"
sarc,871,you shouldn't bring your family into these things. lol! reckon you toads got your heads handed to you at yorktown. gotta love it. now go change your diaper.
sarc,872,Al will need to get a little fitter before the fight but I reckon he could take him! 
sarc,873,"he lives in arizona, a republican state. that explains everything."
sarc,874,"that explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? rotflmao"
sarc,875,"well, there ya go! that explains everything gansao, we have been sincerely debating a serious issue of human development with a simpleton who gets his education from fictional tv. now i understand completely why it has been impossible to reason with him. we are officially wasting our time even communicating with such a person. emoticonxwow emoticonxdonno emoticonxfrazzled"
sarc,876,you certainly make a good point. i have found that most cat lovers are liberals. liberalism is a form of mental illness. that explains alot about cat lovers. :)
sarc,877,so you get your information on science from a creationist lawyer? that explains it!
sarc,878,"ok, the absolutly positively true story. god did exist. but, satan being the wiley deciever he is got him with that very clever paradox ploy. 'god, if you are truely all powerful, can you make yourself not exist?' satan asked. 'but of course.' he replied and with that...*poof* he was gone. that explains why he doesn't do anything. no miracles, no prayers answer, nothing...he's gone. and, for those fools who doubt this, i refer you to the book of job. witness how god jumps to the tune of satan when god withdraws his protection from his loyal and faithful servant...merely to prove a point to satan...without cause!"
sarc,879,"what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. did that baby force her to conceive it? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? no, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards.  that explains everything about how irrational you are! but based on your posts though, i think they already pulled the plug. emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno  "
sarc,880,"what a shock, tq is once again on the wrong side of an issue, and decides to make a spectacle of himself by highlighting the fact that he is completely incapable of understanding basic literary principles. for one, the principle that a man means what he writes. btw, where's jake in all of this? he seems to have gone mia. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,881,what a shock. none of this has anything to do with what i wrote.
sarc,882,"what a shock. easy can't make a cogent point, so he starts ranting scripture and threatening damnation. let me type up his response: '<flush> let's see how smart you are when you're suffering in the pit, you obama-ade drinker.'"
sarc,883,"wow, attacking an argument i haven't even made yet. classy.  arguing the morality of something has nothing to do with religion for me which is why i argue on the morality of the actual act. if you were just going to regurgitate a religious excuse for your answer, as you seem to imply, then yes i would oppose it on those grounds, but if you can't think of a reason prostituion is morally wrong except for your religious answer then you are doing yourself a disservice. the only predictable one here seem to be you."
sarc,884,"wow you can piss standing up, that's loads better than multitasking, manipulating, linguistics and arts. well done you!"
sarc,885,"wowwwwwwwww. you learned how to say something other than 'you are going to hell'. did your mother teach you that, or are you just copying what i'm doing? cuz i doubt you are smart enough to learn anything by yourself."
sarc,886,wow. that shows that my short term memory sucks. ok the 'kitchen' isn't any area in particular. you enter the kitchen by uttering insults.
sarc,887,wow nice job! the 50 character limit is hard to reach and it is a waste of time but up vote for you!
sarc,888,"wow, there you go again. first we can cut health care costs by hiring lots and lots of doctors and nurses and building lots more hospitals... which have to be, you know, paid for. now we can cut postal rates by hiring lots and lots more delivery people! who have to be, you know, paid. in your view it seems that any cost can be reduced by spending more money... it's fascinating really."
sarc,889,"wow, you have a g.e.d. what happened? dropped out of high school? or did you flunk out? judging by you sentences (if you can call them that), you flunked out. and as for me, i have a computer engineering associates degree and i'm working towards my bachelors of science in computer engineering, so keep that in mind. i suppose the 'really important things' that you are learning that aren't reading and writing is how to roll a joint or take lsd since i couldn't imagine what a person who still lives in his mom's basement learns."
sarc,890,"wow, your sex life is based on relativity? i assumed you were quick, but not that bad."
sarc,891,"wow, halloween as tolerance education! how unique! i bet there's a university thesis in there somewhere. you've really hit the head on the nail this time. er, i mean...."
sarc,892,wow! i've never thought about it like that. you've given that a lot of thought ;)
sarc,893,"wow! you're only religious when it's convienent and proves your point. that's how i felt about bush, and he lasted two terms. so if there is any justice, obama will get four terms to fix it all."
sarc,894,"wow! well what do you think that thing is in a woman's womb? a giraffe? with how stupid you are, i wouldn't be surprised if you were a giraffe,"
sarc,895,"wow a down-vote and no dispute, thanks kozlov (edit: or not kozlov?)."
sarc,896,"wow. you're such a racist. 'made of cells'? wow. so what if you're not made of cells? you have something against bots, bro? sheesh."
sarc,897,really!?!?! that high!?!?! wow!!!! cool!!!! do you think i beat out larry the cable guy ;)
sarc,898,are you planning to be dead by age 40? i dunno. do you start to sag by then? wow! are you serious? his death is far worse because he's a total hottie? of course! if channing tatum died tomorrow i would cry. it's a total let down!!
sarc,899,"wow, your just full of logical fallacies today. 'nature and newscientist' here, let me use your logic... ahem these magazines are unrecognized by the scientists i like to listen to so they must be junk. furthermore, they are full of hoaxes and contradictions and are actually quite entertaining. wow, i'm learning logic from nox0 :d pointless reply from redneck, try it again with some argument."
sarc,900,"wow i really have to thank you for being so thorough with your explanations... they totally change the fact that you're comparing murder to interrogation tactics. please draw us another hyperbola, mr. hyperbolan :)"
sarc,901,"wow. someone just thumbsed this down. amazing rebuttal, simply amazing."
sarc,902,"wow, thats some poetic shit. i wonder to you roam around disagree with the people who boost about americas greatest, or how their a force for good. i wonder to you post wise ass comments next to these people. you have no idea how much of a hippocrit you are do you."
sarc,903,"wow many false gods beat an actual one. christinity may only believe in one god, the god."
sarc,904,wow you really don't like america do you? i should start calling you hate monger.
sarc,905,wow. that's an hour's research well-used! can i be your friend?
sarc,906,"so you are attracted to members of the opposite sex due to intelligence? nothing to do with hormones or desires? wow. hormones don't attract you to other people in your gender, and you don't always fall for your desires do you because some of them can ruin your life as you know it. and you know this because their opinion doesn't match yours?  from your 'anything goes' point of views you aren't very moral. yes they can learn to deny who they are ad ridicule people like themselves and wonder their whole lives if they will go to hell for feeling like they do.  quite frankly that reply made no sense."
sarc,907,"wow. just wow. burn me at the stake, why doncha? you were the only reason i stayed cuz i thought we were friends, but now that that is fucked, i will only check in to say hello to friends, and that is it. i fold. you really hurt me. you happy now?"
sarc,908,"wow, so you're saying that christianity should be able to stand the test of extreme scrutiny? are you trying to use this as an excuse to bash it time and again? great idea! i think you should spread the wealth a little! bash some hindus and buddhists and jews! oh, wait- no that is discrimination!!! you racist! i think that christianity has definitely should the test of extreme scrutiny long enough! millions of christians have been killed in history as martyrs."
sarc,909,you mean to tell me i have groupies out there? like a rock star? wow! that's news to me ;)
sarc,910,"wow! you're still going on and on about homos... you are one aren't ya... come on, just admit it."
sarc,911,"you really don't know how insurance works in this country, do you? it's not always the fault of the person for not having insurance... but you don't know this. if you choose not to get insurance that's your fault, end of story. no, education doesn't cost more because of pell grants! are you kidding me? wow. 'no, it doesn't' very convincing argument..."
sarc,912,wow. wouldn't i have banned you from this debate then. and wtf? what are you doing outside of the kitchen??
sarc,913,"wow, you're clever. and some things are dumb. ex, choosing to die when you have the option to live. your lame analogies aside, (yeah, i used the word lame again) one can find new people to hang out with. and again, instead of answering my arguement, you decide to try and insult me. you're right, i must be the one who is dumb..."
sarc,914,50 years? wow! really? is that a typo? exactly which years? from when to when? i'm confused.
sarc,915,wow. okay. photons apparently do not create light? well then i guess i have penetrated the core of your religion.
sarc,916,"wow, i'll make sure not to waste my time typing any more arguments for you from now on."
sarc,917,"wow, you just said something smart. did someone steal your account?"
sarc,918,"wow, thanks for admitting how you really feel about sex apparently. never given your so-called 'wife' an orgasm eh? i sure could...lol..."
sarc,919,"wow, that's a strong decision, there is no way ever god can exist? just a question. or are you slightly less than 7?"
sarc,920,you hate broccoli? wow! you really are a giant freak... wait...
sarc,921,so your disproven scientist work? some of the most brillant minds in our century your disproving that? wow! perhaps you didn't look correctly. there is proven information on a multiverse and a finite universe. there are maps of a possible finite universe that we live in. and also when you type something into the internet it comes up for what you are looking for not extra information like the multiverse. i am telling you there is a finite universe out there and we may even live in one. you should not disable the fact that we don't!
sarc,922,"hold on, you're truly religious? wow! how is that possible? you believe in a big magical being that controls everything because your mommy told you that was the case? if your mom told you that there was a giant pancake in the sky you would believe that. don't be such a naive fucking zealot. god isn't real, however reassuring it is to you."
sarc,923,"wow, so everyone else is just wrong. no chance you could be? i am willing to bet that you also disagree with many christians or they disagree with you at least."
sarc,924,wow. the guy on the video is certainly special... and it's difficult to type while sleep deprived and high on ginger beer.
sarc,925,"wow, good response. you know, attacking foul language instead of making a proper rebuttal makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are."
sarc,926,"""thats just the way it is"" isn't much of an argument! So, basically you don't care that some people can have rights, while others who should have them don't get them. So, I take it you liked segregation, prohabition and prefer women barefoot in the kitchen rather than at the polls voting for anything. Wow! all I an say is wow. "
sarc,927,"You mean to tell me you would deny a life to be lived out and someone to get away with a harmful crime?? wow, sounds like a liberal to me.. "
sarc,928,"yes, it is all due to capitalism. capitalism creates wealth, which develops progress in technology and knowledge.  you're joking, right? the 1900s were nearing the end of the industrial revolution nightmare, where there were no social programs to help those who were literally starving due to poverty. the stock market crash in the coming decades only made things harder for many people, and it occurred with a lack of regulation and law. i'd say that we juggled with knives the better part of the last century and got where we are in spite of capitalism."
sarc,929,"you're joking, right?!?!?! you really believe books, teachers, computers, etc. are more important than a hungry child whose parents cannot afford to pay? wow..."
sarc,930,"are you joking? i hope you're joking. no, it's not logical to believe in god. first, how did we get here? we got here because of evolution. this theory easily explains it. unless you are trolling, you should see the difference between a picture of africa and a picture from the movie avatar. if you are seriously trying to prove your god by comparing real life things with fictional things, then yes, you have proved your god is fictional. thank you."
sarc,931,"if we killed more people that were guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstances. if they don't care about the circumstances they are insane. 'i think, about what they've done wrong in society is by teaching/encouraging/inspiring them, not killing.' so you want the government to brainwash them?  are you kidding me? what planet do you live on?! 'oh, you killed someone but we're not going to punish you at all you just have to go to therapy.' you're joking right?"
sarc,932,"i hope you're joking, otherwise i suggest you see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. people are more important than animals. you can like animals, you can even love animals, you can not want to eat animals, but when you start thinking they're more important than babies you have serious issues."
sarc,933,tennis? you're joking right? it's already been proven that women can take on a man anytime in that game! others not so much but tennis most definately!
sarc,934,you're kidding right? the quangbar tangrians will be abducting you and the rest of the human souls at the end of the world. everyone knows this.
notsarc,935,"You are a known anti-gun supporter, should we really be surprised at your presidential choice. Funny thing is, you are going to get screwed just like the rest of us if Obama wins. He might try to take our guns away, but your rights that are important to you wont be very far behind. "
notsarc,936,"it's not just alcohol and tobacco, but marijuana too; we're just still in prohibition where cannabis is consumed. organized crime surrounding its traffic? check. violent crime associated with the above? double check. lack of quality control resulting in questionable, even dangerous product? triple check! high government spending that doesn't even put a dent on the issue? you get the idea. government scare-tactic campaigns? yeah.... the overwhelming majority of us citizens try marijuana at some point in their lives, and nearly a third are believed to use it somewhat regularly- and it appears to be increasing. some limit!"
notsarc,937,"australian? damn! i guess that's what i get for looking up 'popular american bands' lol. i didn't expect that though. my favorite band is actually australian, so that's cool. guns n roses is classified as an american rock band, since the majority of the members are from america. they wouldn't say 'an american band with a guitarist who is half american and half british'."
notsarc,938,will you stop fucking talking to me? damn. leave me the hell alone. what the fuck is wrong with you?
notsarc,939,"This is not my problem. As I explained above, I just have to show inconsistency in order to reject the validity of all the claims in the Bible as being undeniable truth. And with the Bible, that's damn easy to do. "
notsarc,940,"Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts. "
notsarc,941,"Certainly, because with calm empathy you can casually address such a matter simply because the struggle does not pertain to you personally.   To be able to put into question the love of another human being is simply not only alarming in nature, but damning to the very definition of love, equality, and freedom in creation of man....   And to trump this as a question of morality only serves as a mask to curtail the prejudice objections one personally has to a ceremony, right, and relationship that person will not even be personally affected by.... "
notsarc,942,"no, darling....i'm a religiously 'lax', but 'spiritually active' episcopalian. but, what if i was a believer in the nation of islam? would that justify your bigotry and racism? i think not. check the 1st amendment, which you conveniently omit."
notsarc,943,"i'm not sure how quotes from the other side of the same capitalist, warmongering coin as the republicans has any bearing on any church's support for war. the catholic church, and the us national council of churches (representing most protestant churches) opposed the war. the only church that was apparently in favour were the southern baptists, darling of the 'christian' right."
notsarc,944,john mccain is nothing more than another rino. he is the media's darling from the gop.
notsarc,945,"so your saying the first candidate in many years to actually gain a reasonable amount of bipartisan support is a republican darling? i'm not saying i agree completely with many of obama's policies, because i don't. i would just rather have a candidate who can actually do something. hillary won't be able to because she's such a polarizing figure in politics. it's better to concede some aspects of a bill in order to get it passed than not having it be passed at all because of the stubbornness of partisan politics."
notsarc,946,"quote from simone 'and, being forced to carry to term and give birth to the spawn of a rapist compounds the harm of the rape many times over.' have you thought about therapy darling ?"
notsarc,947,"darling, you're too sensitive. i've never had an issue with your debates. it was a parody of some of the new ones out. you've probably seen them, they ask a question then give yes, because and no, because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no. if i had a problem with yours, i'd be enough of a friend to kindly point it out. again, you're cool with me, don't worry.edit: i see where you've seen what i was referring to. it's early here and i'm not yet awake. but i have to get crank-started and get ready for class."
notsarc,948,"Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences. Or for that matter, Capitalist Science.*You mean 'understanding' written English.**I say 'western' because there are other evolutionary theories - Marxist, Nazi, Feminist etc.Thank you, come again. "
notsarc,949,Oh dear God your ignorance is abundant!   Do you not understand what the federal DOMA law does? 
notsarc,950,"dear chloe, do you really want women tried for murder because they decide to take a pill that will cause an abortion? that is the only logical position a court can take once a zygote, embryo and fetus are legislated into the status of human beings. if one kills a human being, one is guilty of murder."
notsarc,951,"my dear lad, your emotions are too, too chaotic. still them!"
notsarc,952,"no dear! how can we foget about the people who have opened the old age homes for those whose sons have left them? those are real humans!see, we cannot be so pessimistic to look at the negative side,even if the real humans are surrounding us, the brightness of sun cannot be hidden by the patches of clouds"
notsarc,953,"dear marga,  alam naman talaga natin mali ka, kaya i accept mo na tama ang communism :) labyu."
notsarc,954,"i truly understand the significane of the issue. the parent's loss a boy that was very dear and loved by their heart. i don't have a child, but i can't put myself in their shoes. and i may not feel the full impact of emotion, but i get the sense of it. therefore, downvote.  when i said that the community was a fault. i meant that they share the blame for the boy's death. it was their actions as well that tempted the killer to kill the boy. im not saying that the criminal should be sent free tho and that it was him who chopped the boy into peices. but the community is the reason why he killed the boy. therefore, they share a part in the boy's death."
notsarc,955,"dear, as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds/or intoxicated persons. so, logically they can't exercise self control (and that's y we call them mentally imbalanced). i agree , that if a woman says no, it means no. but , in that state of mind a man can't understand that she is denying, what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification. and that's y its a crime . and we have punishments for it.. thank you for ur time. and i appreciate ur views.."
notsarc,956,"believe me, dear sir: there is not in the british empire a man who more cordially loves a union with great britain than i do. but, by the god that made me, i will cease to exist before i yield to a connection on such terms as the british parliament propose; and in this, i think i speak the sentiments of america.  thomas jefferson, november 29, 1775"

notsarc,959,"dear fucking god. why would you want to extend your life more than 30 years?  holy crap, are you mental now too, as all others seem to be? life is poison, time is pain, and every second that i exist, the closer i become to dying. life is purest misery, a clock waiting to break down. it keeps not time, but pain and suffering. the wait of pain is broken up not by content happiness, but only with brain shattering feelings of hope, soon to be smashed into infinite pieces, jagged with the dimensions of agony and memories of laughter never to come again. why do we live? it is not a miracle. it is a curse."
notsarc,960,"winston dearie you really shouldn't make such general accusations, that can get you into trouble. point them out if you can. the shooting in norway, columbine, virginia tech, the tulsa shootings and the tuscon assassination attempt weren't carried out by people a normal person could consider decent and respectable in nature and they were all massacres. you might kill somebody too. you might kill a lot of somebodies for no reason. should you be legislated against and restrained?"
notsarc,961,thanks for bringing me up to speed.. now the debate makes a little more sense. it's certainly an uninteresting theory. it's unfortunate that so many groups have tainted the eureka symbol. i promote the eureka flag to remember the importance of standing up and fighting against those that seek to deny your individual rights. http://www.ausflag.com.au/flags/eureka.html
notsarc,962,"i'm referring to chemist's assertion that mutations cause a beneficial modification to the morphology of hemoglobin. my two links say the hemoglobin becomes 'abnormal,' thus his example fails.  and you are assuming that this mutation is random. why? cancer mutations are not random...they are lead up to by epigenetic changes. why not this? http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-nvo122105.php"
notsarc,963,"by far, my favourite production has been 'the complete works of william shakespeare [abridged]'. we had an absolutely fantastic time, although the script was split to accommodate a cast of twelve, rather than three. it was really just the most fun time, and we were the first show in the history of the organization to be asked to do more performances. it was great!"
notsarc,964,"maddow is pretty fantastic! she's smart, prepared, funny. puts a story in context, and knows how to do an interview - almost always one-on-one, she lets the other person speak, asks pointed questions, etc. best pundit on tv."
notsarc,965,why weren't you on createdebate lately ??? and after reading the book you will be :o the book is fantastic ...happy reading :)
notsarc,966,"i don't require permission to say that the bible is most likely a grand work of fiction. i say this for a number of reasons: . . 1) the bible contains many fantastical elements which cannot be corroborated.  . 2)we do not find fantastical or supernatural elements anywhere else in verifiable history. . 3)people living in ancient times liked to tell tall tales, fables, myths and parables. we have a plethora of examples of this. . . therefore i find it incredibly likely that the bible is a collection of tall tales, myths, fables, and parables and i find it incredibly unlikely that it is a collection of historical events. if you have good reason to think otherwise, then please present your case."
notsarc,967,"So what standards of proof do you hold the bible to? What allows you to hold it next to other religious or fantastical texts and say ""Yes, this one is definately, without fail, the word of God, and this one is not."" "
notsarc,968,"quiet the opposite. fossil records give us a snap shoct of location in time going way back. molecular biology, geology, radiography do so as well. where do you get the idea that there is no evidence? everything we have in our heads is what has been taught to us. shoulder's of giants, hun. it is observed. you and i have about one hundred non fatal mutations in our genotype. remember, most mutations are innocuous. not so. only one of a pathogenetic organism needs this and as mutation is pretty common in rappid generation organisms (bacteria) situations the 'chances' are very much in favour of it happening. remember, mutations are happening to every bacteria every generation at random."
notsarc,969,"i'm a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted: even here in the uk, the first item on the 10 o' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house (waiting for the verdict). i've never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with 'celebrity' ?"
notsarc,970,exactly. the force and energy involved is unfathomable really. i'm absolutely fascinated by the whole thing.  i love my job. :p  waxy
notsarc,971,"that's like making a point that if a woman didn't go out scantily-dressed, there would be no rape in the first place.  i'm flabbergasted you'd even put those two in the same category.  on a side note, where were all you folks with your outrage when this was going on a few years ago: ..... christians in gaza fear for their lives as muslims burn bibles and destroy crosses "
notsarc,972,i moved out on my own at 17.  you have a lot of life ahead of you and i'm impressed that you are keeping your child and involving yourself with these issues at such a young age. i know i wouldn't likely be doing the same if i were 17 again. i would probably be doing the same things i did before. :)
notsarc,973,"i'm intrigued as well, most of the bands are in the same size font, this could turn into a whole new debate!!"
notsarc,974,"when i was in high school lots of the kids stole stuff all the time... stuff their parents didn't want to buy them, peer pressure etc. i'm not trying to be an ass either i'm just surprised at your views on this...  maybe i'll make a debate and we can see what people on here think."
notsarc,975,"this is why i'm tempted to say the us deserves to fail. this isn't a game. don't any of you ###### understand that the time for 'us vs them' is long gone? 'your' guy is not a god, and 'their' guy is not the devil. the whole divisive nature of the us is absolutely incredible. i'm sure i'm not alone when i look on in dumbfounded disbelief at some of the posts on here. you're nation is crumbling, and rather than trying to figure out the best way to save it, some are not-so-secretly hoping the government fails so they can say 'i told you so!' others seem to think as long as they insult the 'other team' enough, everthing will be a-ok. un-believable..."
notsarc,976,"i'll check it out, if in thirty seconds i'm not impressed you'll have my answer."
notsarc,977,"not particularly. reagan was a master as crafting his image. r kelly is the teflon music star. reagan was the telfon president. he even managed to get away from the stain that was the contra affair. many of the most rabid pro-reaganites out there have no idea what that was about and how he was related. so i'm not surprised that if he could avoid being linked to a us backed rape-pillage-and murder of civilians in south america he could get away from the complicated issue of debt, borrowing and general economics which so many americans today have no understanding of."
notsarc,978,"i'm not surprised. i have more than that, i also have common sense on my side. firearms don't facilitate killing, firearms facilitate keeping criminals from getting a corner market on domination. the police are outnumbered by the criminals, the criminals are outnumbered by the law-abiding citizens. we shouldn't be unarmed when we're the majority force in maintaining the balance. too bad."
notsarc,979,"i didn't know that, but i'm not surprised by it. israel needs all the soldiers it can get.  and i disagree with you on the iran war issue. all out war with iran will have the israelis sitting on the sidelines yet again so as not to xxxx off the me allies fighting against iran."
notsarc,980,the majority of women that are of child bearing age will already have at least one child. i'm not surprised at all by this statistic - its what you'd expect it to be.
notsarc,981,"supporting administration's doctrine of pushing iraq deeper into civil war at us expense no longer has public appeal and that's where the votes are. with growing public distrust of administration and congress now at a majority, it'll take a brave or politically suicidal republican congressional member to stay the full course with current administration policy.  i'm somewhat surprised al qaeda hasn't mounted another attack on the us to keep administration in place as their fiscal irresponsibility is al qaeda's best ally. but that could backfire as administration is using iraq to display how they've kept terrorism in the us at bay and another exposed deception could further distance them from public support. al qaeda needs current administration."
notsarc,982,"however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth? very good. philosophers call this type of argument 'argumentum ad populum'. it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit. you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree. shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details. but i think just because they are not 'sure', that doesn't mean that they can't be certain. maybe you could go google 'shakespeare sonnet 1' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection. tell me what you think! i'm sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many."
notsarc,983,"i'm surprised homeland security can't have gun's in dc banned. it's a federal designation, is it not?"
notsarc,984,personally i can't stand it when someone uses 'lol'. it's usually used derisively when politeness suggests that leaving it out and responding politely is in order. personally i'm surprised at this thread. the author apparently didn't read the faq.
notsarc,985,"he's one of your allies, so i'm surprised you'd think so."
notsarc,986,i'm surprised there aren't more people jumping into this one.
notsarc,987,"i'm surprised no one has mentioned the subject of quantum mechanics in this thread. it seems to be a very good example of the concept, instead of perhaps parallel lines. the fact that things can exhibit mutually incompatible properties of either a particle or a wave depending on how we observe them is incomprehensible, yet certainly reality, no? and i think this is just one example of the apparent incomprehensibility of qm . . ."
notsarc,988,i have also read that about lawsuits. these are really sick people. i'm surprised no one has charged them with child abuse as they use their young children in their attempt to terrorize other people.
notsarc,989,"as an outside observer, these are my thoughts too. it's plain selfish and stubborn as far as i'm concerned, i'm surprised that the democratic party itself isn't stepping in, maybe they are behind the scenes. waxy"
notsarc,990,i heard there were star trek cartoons back in the 70s. i'm surprised tv land or the cartoon network hasn't shown them.
notsarc,991,"assuming you're telling the truth, i have to say, i'm surprised. i truly thought you'd support something like this. i'd be interested in hearing you elaborate on your reasons for why you join with any conservative that thinks it's a bad idea."
notsarc,992,"did you ever think that the person who down voted you is the same guy who up voted me? 1. i don't down vote unless absolutely necessary. 2. i'm surprised i didn't, since that comment was useless in the first place. i just decided not to. the way you describe socialism makes it seem as if it were impossible. the government has to get involved in order to make that possible. thus, making the government control who gets what. but otherwise, how does that rebuttal what i said?"
notsarc,993,"i'm surprised, maybe your area of the uk is different, but in mine nearly all atheists are hereditary, or they just break away from the religions of their parents because they dislike their parents instead of the religion."
notsarc,994,"quite frankly,i am astounded by you homosexuals (or homosexual supporters) who claim to hate judging yet judge religious people.....those who judge and those who don't... if i were to say a controversial statement such as 'whats the point of entering an exit?' you would have been hurt or angered..yet you would make disrespectful,hatred-provoking comments that was quite the opposite of the message you were spewing just arguments prior to your comment."
notsarc,995,"that is a poor argument. if you want to become better at debate, in general, don't make statements you cannot back up, but never say that your using 'what i've been told' as an argument. your opposition will tear you apart. :)  lol, it's not like i care that much for this debate, but i will take that into consideration :) i am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others i have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure. if you agree, of course. thank you, and of course. i'd love to debate with you."
notsarc,996,"hellno, i am quite surprised that you complain we have bad weather when axeminster lists all of those."
notsarc,997,i am really surprised this one got so many upvotes :p
notsarc,998,"well, i own a new testament (only the new) book myself. so i am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. what i am saying, and what random dude seem to not get, is that christianity is based on the new testament. we believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. so that is why christianity is based (remember the word based) on the gospels."
notsarc,999,my goodness. i spoke to fast. :) i'll give you that one. i am shocked you even took the time to reply to my petty argument.
notsarc,1000,i am surprised that you would agree with the president of a group that says it promotes ' individual liberties to counter the radical right. '
notsarc,1001,because they managed to convince a bunch of people that somehow by auditing the fed it would amount to a defacto takeover of the fed by congress since looking at their books and total control are obviously the same thing. i am surprised we have not seen any of the major banks using this to refuse their audits.
notsarc,1002,"fair enough. i tend to run skeptic. i am surprised that i am a theist. if you were to believe in a god, which would it be?"
notsarc,1003,"well he is defending the point for what he stands for just like you are defending the point for what you stand for. you said it yourself, you don't measure a crowd by expectations so why then are you measuring a young crowd by expectations? because of the mistakes of a few? i am surprised that you excused the mistakes of a few adults who are immature labeling them as being exceptions when you refuse to do the same for the young generation."
notsarc,1004,"well he is defending the point for what he stands for just like you are defending the point for what you stand for. i didn't say he wasn't. you said it yourself, you don't measure a crowd by expectations so why then are you measuring a young crowd by expectations? because of the mistakes of a few? i said exceptions. not expectations. i am surprised that you excused the mistakes of a few adults who are immature labeling them as being exceptions when you refuse to do the same for the young generation. it's a matter of definition. the young must be generally immature because they are not adults yet. the old must be mature because they are adult. therefore the exceptions work in different ways, an exceptional young person is mature, an exception to older people is immature."
notsarc,1005,very much so i am surprised. i'm usually a totally cynical realist.
notsarc,1006,i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.
notsarc,1007,"i like the band, but for a different reason... i am truly fascinated by the german language, and kulture."
notsarc,1008,"..... yeah i guess so, if you're willing to prescribe them the property of an independent 'human being'."
notsarc,1009,"i agree, it is we that it is ridicules that we have gotten so into controlling stuff that now we even have a way to control natural courses, but i guess like i said before if it is to stop your child from suffering a sickness then i guess that is okay (still bad) but better than just being a complete control freak, or being selfish"
notsarc,1010,"i don't think there should be a minimum wage i agree. i think people should be more comfortable insisting on pay increases. what do you mean? are people uncomfortable with it right now? if you are getting paid poorly...by all means...work poorly. which gets you fired. i guess if someone believes they can get higher pay somewhere else for their same skill set, they can go for it."
notsarc,1011,"well, i am a north european. i thought all europeans opened presents on christmas eve, i thought opening them the morning on 25th was an american thing. but i guess i was wrong."
notsarc,1012,only one of you i guess this is when the score card will come in handy
notsarc,1013,i didn't intend to be hostile. i guess you just interpreted the text in that manner. i'll take the blame for that as well.
notsarc,1014,"no, but i went over there and checked and i guess by time stamp you were first. ;)"
notsarc,1015,i just love how you back down. am i expected to waste my time on this? no. so why the fuck are you?
notsarc,1016,i love how viruses (viri?) and prions make us redefine our notions of life.
notsarc,1017,i love how someone down-votes me without any response it brings laughter to me whoever down-voted me because they don't have the guts to reply to me and then they down-vote me.
notsarc,1018,i love how you cons yell 'race card' when someone points out obvious ethnocentrism. yelling 'race card' does not make me any less right.
notsarc,1019,"i love how he says 'war of terror' not 'war on terror' and everyone claps. thanks for the clip, it's been awhile since i've seen that one. people don't realize but that unbridled rage and nationalism is what led to the rise of hitler and the holocaust as well as pretty much every genocide and war. 'you'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race. ' - george bernard shaw"
notsarc,1020,":d i love how no matter what we're talking about on createdebate, politics, and usually fox news, inevitably comes up. haha."
notsarc,1021,i love when she reaches for that after wards; its like a hotel bed with 'magic fingers'. shakes the whole bed to help me get to sleep.
notsarc,1022,tobi is actually obito uchiha because naruto broke off his mask and in the manga it explained how he survived and kakashi was shocked and so was guy.
notsarc,1023,why debate man ... lets all be friends         agreed with 20/20
notsarc,1024,oh really and what is successful implementation of the law then?
notsarc,1025,"care to support that with statistics? oh wait, you can't. why? because there isn't a global census on what people believe. so unless you've interviewed 7 billion people on their faith (at which point you could inform the un and several other governing bodies), i don't see how you can be in any position to claim 'religion is slowly fading.'"
notsarc,1026,"oh yeah those, i knew this girl once who put those up in her. freaky stuff man"
notsarc,1027,"oh yeah, i don't disagree. i'm a massive fan of hitchens, and 99% of everything he said was true. he just happened to be, as you say, misguided on certain issues."
notsarc,1028,"i think the debate creator is talking about lusting for another person in the biblical sense, whereby you don't actually do anything, you just look at somebody and think to yourself...oh yeah (and that of course is the same thing as adultery in the bible, so after you do that, you can look forward to the fiery lake and torture forever, etc)."
notsarc,1029,"oh yeah. it would definitely be one to remember. i'm sure every holiday with lady gaga would be one to remember. to be honest, she kinda creeps me out lol."
notsarc,1030,"for your answer to that, look at my argument about rehabilitation. oh yeah, i was just messin' around with that previous comment."
notsarc,1031,"watch this guys.  if vor believes that all life is precious, why does he support the killing of death row inmates (many of whom are likely to be innocent) ? why does he support the killing that is happening in iraq? why did he support the reagan policies that supported death squads?  oh yes, because either he's a hypocrite or has huge double standards."
notsarc,1032,"oh yes it does. you would argue that the value, the intrinic value of the rwandian genociders who chopped off limbs and raped women left and right had the same intrinic value when they were born?  a child born in iraq who emigrates to the us and grows up to be a success providing clear benefit to society has the same value as one who grows up to be a suicide bomber? no. value of a person, like all things, changes over time corresponding to their behaviors, events and what happens to them."
notsarc,1033,"oh yes, i know the one. sorry for my horrible memory emoticonxhoho"
notsarc,1034,oh yes ww one other question. are human sperm alive? are they aware?
notsarc,1035,"oh yes a bit on respiration. nematode cysts can go dormant for many years (see anguina triticii) without exhibiting any perceptible respiration or metabolism. so can tardigrades, and many bacteria and fungi. not to mention seed which are dormant sometimes for centuries. are we to conder these objects alive or dead????? are human embryos frozen at liquid n2 temps alive or dead. they certainly are not going to respire at those temps!!!!!"
notsarc,1036,"the best part, jp, was her dialing 911 while shooting at the xxxxxx. mrs. james bond? no, but pretty level-headed grandma, for sure. i bet they won't have another hold-up for awhile. if the rest of these businesses would do the same thing, that sort of job wouldn't be considered 'the most dangerous'. reckon?"
notsarc,1037,"that explains why your politician can work together i bet your current government is made of a collation ? in the uk parliament we still have a first past the post system where the party with the majority form the government.  it is slightly different in scotland we have a hybrid system of pr and first past the post, the politics in scotland has changed slightly in fact the executive is made up of a collation between two parties. this has the effect of making our politics more consensual where parties can actually discuss and negotiation solutions without party politics and vote scoring."
notsarc,1038,"i agree, i think racism is an important issue. it deals with fundamental flaws in human thinking. if 'white supremacy' exists, logic would suggest that 'black inferiority' exists, which is simply the inverse. would this also suggest that 'black supremacy' exists as well as 'white inferiority?' most likely. what does this mean? as long as we keep dividing ourselves based upon skin color, we are going to succeed in staying divided by skin color. we should really be interested in global supremacy, where everybody is happy. i think that is a statistical impossibility though, so that is why most people are just giving up. that explains the moral decline in america, but that is another topic."
notsarc,1039,the word of easy's god is evil! that explains a morally bankrupt lot.
notsarc,1040,"something you seem to have trouble doing yourself. what a shock, you find a source that doesn't agree with you 'biased'. is he a state employee? ### difference does that make? was he subpoenaed? yes. is he honouring the subpoena? no, he's ignoring it. here, how's this? it even fulfills your 'state employee' condition:alaska ag: palin subpoenas won't be honored or how about this?'mccain lawyer scrambles to block a palin ethics inquiry since her selection as running mate, there has been nothing but hurdles to overcome, and a sudden lack of co-operation from the palin camp."
notsarc,1041,"wow wow wow wow..... it depends on what you mean by science, the church i go to doesnt avoid facts. soem extreamists beleieve that people still cant prove were rainbows come from. there are close minded people everywere, why do you pick on monotheistic religions? are you not close minded to atheism then?"
notsarc,1042,wow way to take it to a level that made me think. yes now that i read that you took the debate from a joke to kind of being serious. i agree now that i read your post.
notsarc,1043,"wow. way to pull the worst thing on here. haha. ban someone for debatin? what kind of person does that? why would you do that? i mean really. but honestly, i think she's right. shut up you homo."
notsarc,1044,wow. thank you. i don't think i've ever changed anyone's mind before. this feels pretty good. :)
notsarc,1045,"#1 it offends the 14th amendment/the 14th amendment give's the government the right to appose suicide so suicide should be a crime because the government wrote down some words that allows them to decide suicide is a crime? please tell me you're joking... and #2 human life is sacred and it should not be taken prematurely by anyone. this is a non-cognitive argument. you're taking your personal preferences and deciding everyone should obey them. do you see how egotistical this line of reasoning is?  who are you to say the life was taken prematurely? it's not your life, it's not your call. those who commit suicide die exactly when they intend to, there's nothing premature about it.  i say human life is sacred, therefore no one man can chose what everyone else 'should' do and value."
notsarc,1046,you're kidding me? after all that i just told you and altarion even blocked you from posting messages onto his profile you still try to pull this shit?! how disgraceful of you! >:( this is some low shit you pulled! now i'm telling you: stay away from him!
notsarc,1047,"1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. i haven't watched tv in quite a few years, and when i did i didn't watch c span.  where are the facts that the court has cited? 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself. wouldn't i have to be in denial in the first place though?"
notsarc,1048,"gay dreams are pretty common among men, but it doesn't make them gay erm.. you've had dreams about having sex with men? i think you're kidding yourself if you think that's normal for a straight guy."
notsarc,1049,"well...., i hope you're kidding because i don't think that's a fair assessment."
sarc,1050,"I think I understand this. The goal is clear, check. Self-restraint is good, check. But I do not see what this has to do with the OP. Could you explain, please? Who are you recommending should use self-restraint? The protestors? Or are you saying, self-restraint is your recommendation for birth control? "
sarc,1051,"Oh you do love to do the psychological technique known as 'transference' don't you...or is it 'projection'???  You are so obsessed with gay sex, I would not be surprised if you and Ted Haggard have a lot to talk about. "

sarc,1053,"so the quickest way to get over 20,000 points is to not be serious? check!"
sarc,1054,"oh, i agree with you...oh wait, did a clarify argument show up in the argument listing? damn! i think it did!"
sarc,1055,"1. in ww2 it was already settled that uniform personal were subject to decent treatment. and that's how it has always been. unfortunately, terrorists are not uniformed and do not abide by these rules. if we try and fight them using geneva rules, it's basically like sticking a stake into our heart. soldiers are discharged for firing a gun into the ground in order to intimate a captured enemy combatant. ah, good ol' international law. no one remembers what war is, i guess. 2. you didn't know that terrorists kill innocent women and children? damn."
sarc,1056,"why would you want to go to heaven? to talk to everyone who hates gays? to look down on the people suffering in hell? just for your own personal selfish satisfaction and pleasure from being in heaven, a place of good things, rather than hell, a place or eternal torture and misery? damn."
sarc,1057,"And you have been refuted time after time. Lies, damn lies and statistics is a starting point. Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be. I bet you strongly believe its possible to pick up a turd by the clean end. "
sarc,1058,"'Life threatening condition that is always physically harmful""? What a giant load of steamy BS. Rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening.

Where do you get this BS from, Planned Parenthood? "
sarc,1059,"if it were up to the thought pattern of individuals that produces this, then not only would we be speaking with a british accent because the left can't stomach any war that goes beyoned five years, but you would have left adolph hitler alone too until he invaded poland.  and for the record, the u.n. isn't working on sanctions against iran because they are good and innocent, but because they feel, like i and many others do, that iran is engaging in deceptive and non-cooperative behaviors. and when the darling of the liberal left - the u.n. - feels that way, then maybe there's a lot more to it than you think you know. by the way, how did you like that fatwa for nuclear weapons?"

sarc,1069,"see simone sweetie that's what i've been talking about. as far as you're concerned liberals are capable of doing absolutely no wrong. even the child raping mayor doesn't get a second look from you. people like you have made left-wing liberals into your religion and you see obama as your veritable messiah. obama could sign an executive order calling for the extermination of 10 million christians, jews and catholics in an effort to wage war on bitter religion clingers and you wouldn't so much as bat an eye at the idea. you really shouldn't so blindly give out your trust to one particular political party dearie. it'll betray you every single time and you'll be too engrained to know what to do. that's why i'm an independent."

sarc,1072,"i probably wasted time creating this debate. everyone knows blacks commit more crime than other races. who in their right mind is going to argue with that? oh wait, aveskde would argue with a sign post if it was crucial to holding his fantastical world-view together, maybe he'll bite. :)  you're projecting. you'll find that few things enrage me or emotionally motivate me."
sarc,1073,"are you really that christian-abused that you have never read the jubelees? have you never read any of the scriptures that are not contained in the bible?  i hate to be the one to inform you, but there are a whole ton of scriptures that were excluded from the biblical compendiumn. try doing your own research and stop expecting others to do it for you.  i didn't 'dream up' the story of jesus tossing his friend off the roof, it's real...look it up! and i hate to remind you, but i'm agnostic. so belief in ghosts and spirits is reserved for physical proof. since ghosts and spirits are non-corporal it's highly doubtful to me that a baby could ever have been concieved without outside help.  man, you guys will believe anything as long as it's written in that ancient book, hun?"

sarc,1085,"gary, you think i'm completely wrong? i'm shocked! really i am... somehow i suspect you'd also find a way to say i was completely wrong if i said schools should still use books... and come on, why can't i call you a lunatic? you know i want to."
sarc,1086,"i think you're not understanding me. skin color is genetic. you are saying the skin color represents genes. ...we're arguing for the same thing. i know, i'm shocked."
sarc,1087,"agreed, and they are really grasping at straws now. i'm surprised that anyone still takes kennedy seriously. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,1088,"what i appear to have, what we all appear to have, is another case of you not following the thread. of course, pro-gay republicans are few and far between... that was my point.  thanks ever so much for dredging up their website. did you notice that the 'latest news' was from last july? of course, that's better than their 'in the news' area... where nothing past 2001 and 2002 is posted. lol frankly, i'm surprised they bother to update the website at all. they're dead in the water... quite pathetic."
sarc,1089,"i must be blessed to be surrounded by so many posters with a direct line to god so that they know who is saved or in hell. with christians as well-informed as this, i'm surprised god doesn't just retire and let them take over. after all, 6,000 years since creation must be enough for anyone."
sarc,1090,i'm surprised theodore roosevelt hasn't come back to kick some major @$$. how many other presidents to you know that got shot and still delivered their speech before going to the hospital? if andrew jackson were still around he'd literally be beating these anti-gun fanatics over the head with his hickory cane. you don't get much more serious than a president who said one of this greatest regrets was not killing his own vice president when he had the chance.
sarc,1091,"if the federal government wants to pay for it, fine. the federal government has no business telling private insurance companies how to run their business. especially if they have religious ties. i'm surprised anyone wanted to put their dick inside your rotted out pussy."
sarc,1092,"you are brainwashed, actually. i'm surprised you can't see that. i mean really, pretend you are an atheist. if you read what you just wrote, you'd think you're brainwashed too."
sarc,1093,"wow, talk about a hypocrite who tells jito to read what he said, and then directly afterward comes up with something that she didn't say. i can't say i'm that surprised, jp. as to what she was talking about - she was (accurately) describing you as a bigot with hatred toward gays, evidenced by your many statements here, including the one she quoted in which you called her family a deviation."
sarc,1094,"it's just fabulous that unity amongst republicans can disrupt a democratic process for a fair and honest election. republicans have their candidate. mccain is a shoe-in. so now some republicans can turn their focus to disrupting the democrats process. i am amused that the party that espouses 'family values' doesn't include honesty as one of those family values. i have yet to hear of any republican condemning such acts. i guess 'do what you can to ensure a victory' is 'moral' now... and on the flip side, for any democrats voting to disrupt the republican primary process, they are equally repugnant. but at the same time, i haven't heard anybody as high level as 'limbaugh' advocating what he just did. (i don't typically listen to the punditry crowd (with some exceptions), so what i haven't heard may not be a good authority.)"
sarc,1095,"are you talking about this one??? he was talking about 'god'. he never said your 'god'. and i am both amused and bored by the fact that i just explained to you how evolution and a belief in a creator can co-exist, and you completely ignored it. but you're going to continue to claim that they are mutually exclusive, won't you..."
sarc,1096,"seven demons, huh? is that a lot? small chance of clean living with those guys on board, huh? interesting. i am intrigued that you believe in demons. do they still exist? if so, how are they manifest and how would you know that?"
sarc,1097,the ones that make you stupid. you are so passionate about this thing that your judgment is impaired. i am kind surprised that you let your emotions influence your quest for truth. atlas shrugged is as dangerous as the bible and people like you are as bad as religious fundamentalists.
sarc,1098,"'the guy is an idiot' he's a kid cut him some fucking slack, he might not have a suitably refined message, and he may able to correctly articulate his position but im sure he knows why he's there. '.i would suspect if most were interviews they would say the same thing.' why i am not surprised, you obviously wouldn't think for second that maybe the tv went around interviewing lots of people in order to find a flaky guy they could single and use to defame the movement, that thought could never enter your mind? what you think thats not how tv stations work? 'they want people to work for them....support them. they are moochers' the majority of them have jobs, what the fuck are you talking about, your small minded bigoted position is as clear as ever, you would have been a fine nazi."
sarc,1099,"never said anything about a 'lost speech'. but who knows? he may have had his speech writers prepare half a dozen different speeches. the community organizer knows when to push and when to back off. there was enough of a public outcry for him to realize that this was not the time to push. so he backed off and wasted the country's time by re-hashing old wisdoms. i am rather amused about the labels thrown out by you, simon and foundit. just because i had the audacity to criticize the anointed one i am a hysterical racist. keep them coming."
sarc,1100,"uncalled for, my nationality doesn't have much relevance to this, but nah you can go on pretending you're the only country in the world and shoot yourselves to hell, it's about what i'd expect. you see i hear something like the school massacre in europe, i am shocked, but in the usa it's a regular occurrence! but nah, you keep your guns if they make you happy, go play with your boom booms. i know 18 kids who won't have a happy christmas!"
sarc,1101,wow! i am soooooooo amazed by your come back skills... another epic fail!
sarc,1102,i disagree with it because there is no god. these are your words: 'i propose that a standard of good or evil cannot be defined by humans or human constructs.' i guess i shouldnt be surprised that i cant get a straight answer. you dont know. i am surprised your 'god' has not provided you with more adaquate ansures.
sarc,1103,"i am surprised to hear you, a card-carrying christian, defending the civil rights of polygamists! wonders will never cease!  obviously the point flew right past your noggin. gay people are discriminated against because they are gay! but then, you folk think that's just fine. a few years ago, you'd have been blowing hard about 'activist' judges allowing interracial marriage. how dare they stand up for equal rights! emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,1104,"i am surprised (well not really) that you don't see the simularity. and, we must not forget the elvis believers too"
sarc,1105,seriously though simone. clinton has a record of forcing himself upon women . i am surprised that you have any time for him. bet you like teddy kennedy too!
sarc,1106,"there is no limit to what chuck norris can do. i am surprised he hasn't broken into your house for talking to him like that. but perhaps the kindness in his heart makes him better than that. jesus is a hippy, so i don't see how he could take him on. there is no limit to what jesus christ can do. i am suprised that jesus christ hasn't taken your soul since you compare a god to a mortal. but he still loves you and wants to be in a relationship with him. chuck norris is a mortal, i don't know how he can defeat a god."
sarc,1107,i just love how deliciously ironic this statement here is. well done.
sarc,1108,i love how the apple fan is illiterate. what exactly is the great thing that apple invented?
sarc,1109,i love how point-whoring/farming is allowed when it's in the form of this.
sarc,1110,"i love how you reply without putting any thought into your post, it is awesome. the answer to my question was no. your computer screen is not absorbing light from the sun and reflecting the color yellow back to you. thanks for playing, you lose. we know you don't actually believe in science, so you can stop trying to quote it."
sarc,1111,i love how i am getting under your skin. it really amuses me and your wish is my command.
sarc,1112,i love how scumbarge doesn't give a rebuttal to this. he knows you have him by the balls.
sarc,1113,i love how you managed to make a counter-troll sound like a serious reply :)
sarc,1114,i love it when you bash people for stating opinions and no facts when you turn around and the same thing...i take it you have proof of a lie (keep in mind that lying is not the same as being wrong). as for hagel...i will assume he is actually in iraq right now and wrote that. give me a break emoticonxrolleyes
sarc,1115,"i love it when christians say this...pay who, for what, whose sin? if he is god, no one had to die for anything. he could blink his eyes and everything would be as he wanted!"
sarc,1116,"i love it when people manipulate statistics in order to attempt to prove a causal relationship that doesn't exist. considering the fact that more women vote than men, one could argue that their views are over-represented. "
sarc,1117,"i love it when straight, christian folk who disapprove of gays seem to know so much about what it is to be gay - how it feels, how they became that way, the nature of their relationships and whether or not its something they can control. hey archangel - if you ever need brain surgery i know a fantastic auto mechanic you can talk to. emoticonxrolleyes"
sarc,1118,i love it when the left dogs beck but blatantly shows their bias by not covering news stories detrimental to our pot-earred president. ;)
sarc,1119,"i love when people say 'personal property' of the mother....since when is a life personal property? oh, my mistake, slaves were."
sarc,1120,lol i love when people open their mouths and don't read the thread. i'm pro-choice btw i have no problem with anarchy. also i'm not the one arguing for twiller's death. i said its understandable not that i condone it. you can understand why someone did it while not condoning their actions. seriously read the thread before you open your mouth less embarrassment and looking like a preaching crone that way.  frankly i'm all for abortion if not to keep idiocy out of the gene pool. @cun: depends on how soon the egg was going to hatch. if it was due to hatch in a day yeah i consider you having killed a chick.
sarc,1121,i love when random myth followers talk about critical thinking :d
sarc,1122,"wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again."
sarc,1123,"oh really, a combination of the words expel and arm mean to expel arms? wow, she was a creative genius! i think what he meant was rowling just takes all the stereotypical magicy stuff and mashes it all together into a tacky and overused paste."
sarc,1124,"oh really, you've been dead before? what's that like? should i dress warm for heaven or is it kind of chilly up there in the clouds?"
sarc,1125,oh really? then why don't we go naked and live in a forest or jungle? ................ i did not mean to say that i say we are different but the same.
sarc,1126,"why do they have to accept this? why doesnt the government just find a solution that satisfies both parties? oh right, because that would eliminate this great topic at election time."
sarc,1127,"accountable by trial? by following the advice given to them? how about holding the advisors accountable? oh wait!! how about holding the people who put the advisors in power accountable? oh shit!!! hold the government accountable! hold the people who put government accountable. hold every citizen accountable. nice work, captain hindsight. you put yourself at trial. 'i shouldn't have acted like i know more about drilling for oil than oil companies'."
sarc,1128,"yes, and you are playing white knight for gays everywhere. i wonder which is more annoying? oh wait. i already know."
sarc,1129,bambam you're parents are on dope! they probably help the mexicans bring that shit into the country. who names a kid barack and who's last name is obama? messed up parents... oh wait he never really did have parents cause he had 2 mothers and 2 fathers!
sarc,1130,"the amount of people that kill their wife/husband/boss/friend/randomer out of a sudden bout of rage is considerably high. and besides, even if we save one persons life, that's good?? oh wait no, all you industrialists care nothing of the little man, your own necessities are more important.  and what sort of an arsehole says ' some people have to die..' can't you just put them in jail?? who are you to decide who has the right to die or not? how can i argue with someone who says 'killing is bad, unless you kill bad people'. oh wait, you never said killing was bad."
sarc,1131,"do you actually think that asking worthless questions will help your side? oh wait, obviously you do, that's all you ever ask. why are you trying so hard to deny the fact that conception originates a new organism?  irrelevant  that conception is the beginning of that new organism's life and physical existence? irrelevant that conception is in that respect, the birth of a new organism?  my definition does not allow for this conclusion. why does that fact bother you so much? if you are right, then all words are worthless and meaningless. if you are right every word means every other word."
sarc,1132,"i do not understand how sexism, slavery and filicide fit into a being that is supposed to be infinitely moral. care to justify that for me? oh wait... you can't."
sarc,1133," and in the case of all prenatal medicine  it is the pregnant woman who is the patient  not the fetus. Shouldn't a doctor be able to act in the interests of the patient without fear of imprisonment? IIRC  this was the issue most important to Justice Harry Blackmun (a conservative appointed by Richard Nixon) who authored the court's opinion on Roe v. Wade.The Roe v. Wade Opinion"" a doctor can't kill someone else to save the life of another, so I would say that is probably not a good arguement. Not only that, find \right to privacy\"" in the constitution...oh wait  not there. Guess its on the back.""  "
sarc,1134,oh yeah god is the root of all evil! tell that to the person who was about to murder their spouse for cheating but refrained from doing so because they believe that god is watching. how about that damn evil mother theresa too
sarc,1135,"then it will open the door to eventual total control. oh yeah, most autocratic regimes started with governments taking away child beauty pageants! just to confirm, i don't disagree that they shouldn't ban them, i just think making such a statement, that is such great speculation, and has so little basis in fact, is reasonable."
sarc,1136,"oh yeah you're right! i suppose only sane americans get guns! no wonder 0% of the population are killed in gun warfare. oh wait, a considerable amount of people are killed by guns. silly me! of course all the sane people can also shoot who they want in some states, just because they feel threatened by it. sure keep guns, advocate them why don't you. after all, all those people killed, and the families of those people.. hasn't happened to you, so why should you care?!?! (noob...)"
sarc,1137,"scratches and bruises versus a gunshot wound. oh yeah, he was totally in the right to kill the kid."
sarc,1138,"QUOTE yes there it is the word that is favorited by the liberals!!! biiiiiiigot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh yeah!!!!!!!!  END QUOTE my friend, you are supposed to be a christian, jesus was the biggest liberal of his day. QUOTE and yes you are demon possessed. END QUOTE you can of course prove this?"
sarc,1139,"'slaves, tortures, drones, dictators' hmm, what does that sound like? oh yeah, the history of most european countries, including germany."
sarc,1140,"you don't know? oh yeah... you're supposedly married to that teenager, prodigee."
sarc,1141,"he can't sin, get a teenage girl knocked up on a one night stand, but not sin. slaughter innocents personally or command his followers to do so but can't sin. oh yes he isn't very good at watching out for his kids. i mean look at adam and eve and then he got another chance with jesus and look how that turned out. and see above for other things he can't do."
sarc,1142,"and yet you ignored the specific link mentioning the current regs while asking for it at the same time.  no, i dislike your techniches because they are unethical, hold double standards, and aren't based on facts.  oh yes, who was the one who asked for the reg link while ignoring it at the same time?  the fact that you quote newsmax says much about how much credence anyone here gives you."
sarc,1143,"then why have you attacked kerry and other democrats for voting aganist abortion bills that did not have such clauses?  oh yes, i know why, because you're a lying hypocrite."
sarc,1144,"i don't know, terran. are you scared poohbear? do you actually have any evidence to bring to us? we'd love to see some! really we would! if you could show us some hardcore, physical evidence that proves god did it, it would be the scientific revelation of the century! oh what's that? you don't have any? not even a poorly crafted straw-man argument? damn, and here i was thinking you were capable. oh yes, and if you could give us some firm, solid evidence that darwin is burning in hell, we would all drop our copies of origin and bow down the lord.  whats that? you don't have any...?"
sarc,1145,oh yes i forgot people who disagree with you don't know what they think.
sarc,1146,"oh yes, you're the one 'winstonsmith' thinks is so bright."
sarc,1147,"indeed. and even worse, a being who is omniscient and does nothing to prevent evils is by association guilty.  the idea that the biblical god which is omniscient is all loving is ridiculous. oh yes, i know everything that will be, including situations where i myself will have to exterminate millions of people and yet i do nothing to prevent the situation where i will have to exterminate millions of people from coming true. in the sane world, we prosecute people for knowing about crimes and doing nothing. i bet jyoshu would look down on someone who knew about a school shooting that killed dozens and did nothing to prevent it. but apparently he doesn't apply his standards to his god.  apparently god is not subject to moral standards. that's pretty ****ed up."
sarc,1148,"i never did blame our black people for the mess that country music is today. reckon i ought to start laying that on them, too? emoticonxcool"
sarc,1149,"a minute without kids? what's that? :) and about the thread - it might be a touchy subject. reckon? oh, and thanks - i feel 28! emoticonxcool"
sarc,1150,"that explains the incentive of a lot of common folks. it does not apply to their leadership. frankly, i don't think many evangelical leaders who fight gay rights actually hate us. i think they're deeply grateful for our existence. we make them so much money...."
sarc,1151,"that explains why he's been identified as the most liberal voting senator of 2007...because he hasn't much of a rating. honestly, it is amusing when liberals try to explain things."
sarc,1152,"what a shocker. let me paraphrase: anyone: not following you aa, can you support or clarify what you're saying here? aa: nope!"
sarc,1153,"wow...just...wow! seriously, my post pretty well just saaaaailed on over yer lil head, didn't it? that 'ol stupid train...just kept runnin over ya, didn't it? runnin over ya! lol i guess my incredibly obvious cynical sarcasm was just not ~quite~ earth shatteringly obvious ~enough~, huh sparkles? tha'fawk...they sure are breeding you kids slow these days! you be sure and have fun trying to 'debate' something which has been made totally irrelevant by modern technology! :d 'gun control'...lol, you trainables might as well be arguing for earthquake control! aha ha ha ha ha ha! you don't ~control~ earthquakes, you prepare for them! herpity derp!"
sarc,1154,"wow, i don't understand how this keeps happening. i'll try to switch mice."
sarc,1155,wow! i didn't know that. thanks! should i read the new york times instead?
sarc,1156,wowie! well shut my mouth and watch me wilt!!! lmao. 50times50
sarc,1157,"wow, these are some very nice values, lets teach them to everyone else! if the bible says so, why not? you seem determined to debate about a book of flawed values. are you sure you are defending this book of it's values? because surely you must have some kind of religious point of view to even think of protecting a piece of old literature."
sarc,1158,"wow, this was up to 6 points at one time. down-voting it without a rebuttal surely refutes it."
sarc,1159,"wow!! your such a guy! i bet you watch lingere womens football too dont you. womens basketball is on a much higher level then men. i bet you couldnt even tell me what a shot clock, three point shot, foul shot, or even what layup is. maybe if your tried watching womens basketball you would see how it is on a high skill level and how some wnba teams could beat mba teams."
sarc,1160,you really believed me? wow! i never knew i had such power ;)
sarc,1161,please tell me you're kidding. these bowling balls must be flat if you're not
sarc,1162,"you're kidding. just because your life is 'a fricken breeze' that doesn't mean the other 7 billion people on this earth have a breezy life. have you even watched the news lately? it's either that, or you live on another planet."
sarc,1163,the evidence that is provided to you is not enough. not that evidence is not given.  nice closed-minded-ness buddy.  ethnocentrism? lol! you're kidding right? you think what i wrote is particular and not broad ranged? what are you assuming here?
sarc,1164,"you're kidding, right? i mean, you really don't know who i am? what am i missing? is this some alternate reality? where's the camera :)"
